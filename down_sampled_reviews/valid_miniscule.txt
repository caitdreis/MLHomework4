I find the espresso it makes on the weak side, but my co-workers sharing the machine like it, so I guess it's a matter of taste. Very nice crema.
The book was received promptly and in great shape. Excellent vendor.Charles Muhle
SPIDER LABYRINTH is like a mix of brutal 1970's italian "giallo" meets the "old school" sentiments of the Hammer Horror films. It isn't about the gore (which does get pretty bloody in the last fifteen minutes), but rather it's strengths lie within the pacing and atmosphere. Going for more of a straight forward approach with the story telling, this movie has equal measures of suspense and horror. All of which is mixed together with the right amount of brooding, gothic atmosphere. SPIDER LABYRINTH is truly the unexpected Horror gem of it's genre.Who would have thought this late into the 1980's Horror and Slasher craze that such an imaginable film would slip between the cracks? Heck, I never heard of it until just recently and I consider myself to be pretty well seasoned in the world of Horror! How did this happen!?! SPIDER LABYRINTH is too good of a film to be unknown! Yet, it seems to have fallen into obscurity some how. It's just a shame that this isn't really an official DVD release of the movie. This version is a "print on demand" film. The quality itself isn't too bad. I think it's a VHS to DVD transfer. Still, this is about as good as it gets!When most people think of "giallo" Horror films, such classics as THE BEYOND and SUSPIRIA come to mind. This movie is on the same level as those other films, yet it has a sense of originality on it's own. Like I said before, I never heard of SPIDER LABYRINTH until I started trying to dig up the more obscure films of this genre type. It's not that hard of a movie to find (after all, I did buy my copy online and got it quickly) but it is hard to learn about the actual film. Outside of some online critics, you don't see too much about this movie. SPIDER LABYRINTH isn't as well known as SUSPIRIA or HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY, but it is just as good!The film itself takes elements from ROSEMARY'S BABY, BODY SNATCHERS, THE EVIL DEAD, INFERNO, THE THING and mixes it all with an H.P. Lovecraft vibe to boot! Style wise it kinda' reminds me of the Hammer Horror days, where a lot of attention was given to the set designs (which are amazing here) and all the actors do their best despite the production limitations. SPIDER LABYRINTH might be a little low budget but that doesn't mean everyone involved doesn't do a good job. Also, the music in this film is very creepy and well done. I consider this to be "classic" Horror movie direction.The plot is about this College professor who is sent to Budapest by his school to look for a missing fellow professor. Once he gets there, strange things start happening right off the bat. First of all, a number of people have pulled him aside and told him to escape from the city while he still can. Then a few deaths start cropping up, invovling some pretty unsettling and odd circumstances. Like a man being hung to death with what seems like a huge, thick spider web! Eventually the movie builds up full steam as hideous spider monsters and a secret cult bring everything to a horrifying and bloody climax!This movie does feel more like Hammer Horror than "giallo" but thats no problem really. The mix is a welcome combination and once you finally see the movie, you'll understand why it's so popular. It's just a good 'ol fashioned spooky Horror film with some of the more grizzly aspects (blood and gore) of the late 70's italian Horror scene. It's hard to believe this movie came out during the late 1980's! Gore Hounds, check it out for multiple stabbings, tons of make-up effects and an especially disgusting ending! SPIDER LABYRINTH is truly a hidden Horror gem!Five stars without a doubt!Horror fans, check it out! Unless that is, you don't like spiders!
I, like countless others stranded in front of a TV with basic cable throughout the 80's, grew to love "Where Eagles Dare". "Where Eagles Dare" is not a good war movie. It's not even a good movie movie. Why is it so popular? Because it's loads of fun!With hardly a passing glance at realism, a confusing, ludicrous script, and a series of plot twists "so hackneyed it would make Stan Lee blush" (thank you, Comic Book Guy), "Where Eagles Dare" belongs at the bottom of any stack of war movies that also includes "Saving Private Ryan" or even "Patton". Cruel, simplistic, patrician, it holds dear none of the lessons of wartime comradery, the preciousness of life or the ultimate futility of war that we are made to understand from the popular war movie 'book'. "Where Eagles Dare" begins with untrustworthy spy-movie-Fu, develops irresponsible cruelty, and ends with daring idiocy.So what's good in here, anyway? Clint Eastwood's gruff swagger. Richard Burton's top-spook cunning. The combat scenes, where the very locations become characters and plot devices. The blessed, blessed paucity of dialog; this film's soundtrack is snowy wind ambience, gunfire and musical score, punctuated by brief lines from Burton.The combat scenes in the beginning and middle of the film are excellent; they trade realism for panache, and aren't afraid to put Eastwood against impossible odds, laying it on thick with the grenades and bottomless clips (very few shooting movies have the stones to make up for this particular gaffe). Things start to fall apart near the ending chase scene, but by that point you've sat so long on sweaty hands through the tense getaways and cliffhangers that it doesn't matter how it wraps up. Which is a good thing, since the final scene assures confused viewers that the plot is disposable anyway.This is not a desert island must-have. This is a film to fill a long Saturday afternoon; play it inbetween "Ronin" and "Starship Troopers", not "Schindler's List" and "The English Patient". It's no wonder this film was so popular on TNT and other cable channels in the 80's; it's the just the thing for a brain comfortably in the "off" position.
Joy Chant's Red Moon and Black Mountain was probably my favorite book as a young adult. Though obscure and woefully under acknowledged, this 'modern day people drop into alien world' saga is the absolute BEST of it's ilk. It combines both mysticism and fantasy, battle and intrigue into an absolutely spellbinding story. I truly think this marvellous work is dismissed by many as being another 'Tolkien lite' but the story is so much, MUCH more. Like Tolkien, Ms. Chant is able to define several rich and varied cultures and do so skillfully in the same book - but that is where the similarity ends! The Hurnei bear very little resemblance to Tolkien's horse peoples - and their culture is, in fact, much more richly detailed (in The Grey Mane of Morning - another of Ms. Chant's books in this universe) than Tolkien's Rohirrim.There are images and names in this book that I have kept in my heart for more than 30 years. That of Vir'vachal riding her earth colored pony through the earth, of the flame and gold of Dur'chai's coat, the sweet terror Li'vanh Tuvoi feels when he jumps to his death, the beautiful but terrible face of the fallen Prince of Heaven as he sees the little being who has defeated him. The Dancer at his Fountain... The child 'death-eyed'... I have not laid eyes on this book for more than 20 years and STILL I remember these details! This was a story that sang to me, that made me ache and filled me with joy at the same time. Perhaps I am the only person on the planet for whom this book spoke such volumes, but if I can convince another of its worth, another who would hear this story, these peoples, sing as I have, then it is worth the time I take to write this review.
I love finding Japanese artists that are not mainstream. Unfortunately they are hard to come by in America. This album is definitely one of I's Cube's best. She has a very unique voice that reminds me of Alanis Morissette.
I first heard the A-Lines on pandora - and I was blown away. This is what happens when you mix the Ramones with 60s Garage Rock and add a dose of Elastica - in other words this is an awesome album.1 From the opener, "Four" with its pounding beat and ramones like infectious 3 cord rock to the closer "Last one there" which seems to channel (in a good way) Jethro Tull reimagined as a punk band.If you like the Ramones, or just good driving beats, you owe it to yourself to track down this album.
When I saw the low price for this one, I knew I had to have it. I vividly remember watching Batman on WTBS a long time ago along with its contemporary TV series. One of the things that makes this such a great film is its presentation that makes it enjoyable on multiple levels. When I was a kid I didn't think it was funny but rather thought it was a great action movie featuring the heroic dynamic duo. When I was older and saw it again I realized how hilarious it is.This DVD is fantastic. The movie looks like it was made yesterday instead of the sixties. The commentary from Adam West and Burt Ward is entertaining and there are some nice extras included.With the proliferation of TV series on DVD, I can't help but wonder when we'll see the show released to a waiting public.It may be campy and not the favorite of "true" Batman fans, but I still believe the original is still the best.
The latest from the master of film, Steven Spielberg, Minority Report is a very entertaining film. Minority Report, starring Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell and others, is about a man in the future, who is being hunted for a Pre-Crime he does not believe he will commit. He has a certain amount of time before the pre-crime is supposed to take place, and tries to search for answers before it is too late. (This is a very, extremely, dumbed down version of the synopsis)Spielberg tried to draw on the film noir genre to make the film, and doing this definitely gave the film a much more dark feeling overall. There was a certain sense of mystery to the whole movie, and while it is fairly predictable who the villain is,(there are only a limited amount of main characters in the movie, which is why it is predictable) the ride to get to that point where the movie reveals the villain is altogether thrilling, and visually astonishing.As much as others have said the movie is loaded with action, I have to disagree. The movie has a couple nice action sequences, yes, but in reality, considering the movie's long running time, there weren't that many. The reason why the movie seemed action filled from beginning to end was really because Spielberg truly was able to convey a sense of excitement and intrigue through the dialogue. It reminds me of what the movie "The Beach" wanted to be -a thriller without the action, but where "The Beach" failed, Minority Report has succeeded.That is not to say there aren't some nice scenes with action of course. The one I loved the most was the sequence where John Anderton (Tom Cruise) has to jump from one car to another, while all the cars are going down a literally vertical highway (the futuristic highways remind me of rollercoasters).Many felt that the ending to this was way too drawn out, and similar to Spielberg's last movie AI, should have cut out the last 20 minutes or so. I disagree, as I felt the last part of the movie gave it that finishing touch that makes it even more film noir like.Spielberg has also revealed a darker and more morbid sense of humor that may have come from his tangle with Kubrick in AI. One of the scenes that perfectly illustrates this new Kubrickan Spielberg is one where a man in the movie has to chase after his own eyeballs, bouncing down a hallway -something that is sickeningly funny, and definitely a type of scene that was previously not part of Spielberg's film vocab.Overall, Minority Report is a thoughtful thriller that definitely warrants at least one viewing.
Jacques Pepin returns in a 3 DVD disc set that is a visual companion to his book of the same name, both a sequel to the original series Fast Food My Way. In a way, the Fast Food series are a testament to a long distinguished career, showcasing how all those years and experience can culminate in the most difficult frontier for any master in his craft: simplicity.8 Episodes per disc, each beginning with an idea for a quick, throw-together dish appetizer ("minute" recipes), a warm welcome from Jacques and a 30 minute episode comprising of a 1st course, a main dish, and a dessert. Wine pairings are also gently suggested, with type and region noted.Each show features combinations that are presented as menus at the end of book equivalent. Knowing how to match dishes to compliment the palette is, in itself, an art form.The recipes have an international expanse (although onion, garlic, "good" olive oil, chives, parsley, and sour cream seem to be the recurring staples), ranging from seafood Paella (tried this recipe: delicious!) to baked lobster loafs using hot dog rolls, sauteed mustard greens with spicy Italian sausage, New England style chowder, middle eastern coucous with veggies, pork medallions in pomegranate sauce, tibetan bread (ready in 15 minutes!) shrimp with cabbage and caviar, almond paste Mont Blanc and Salmon Pizza on lavash bread, and my favorite one, potato gnocchi with eggs and truffles. There is also some simple but surprisingly elegant looking desserts that will sure be a delight to guests, ranging from apricot clafoutis to cherries in Armagnac sauce, and a fancy raspberry tart on cookie dough. Daughter Claudine joins him for a few episodes, providing light banter and added familial warmth. You can get a taste of the menu of this 3 dvd set by having a peek at KQED's website's Pepin page.The basis of Pepin's "Fast Food" is the edict that you should look at your supermarket as your prep cook. "Make your supermarket work for you!" So whether it be something as obvious as rotisserie chicken (you make the sauce), cream cheese, prepacked salmon, canned caviar, seedless raspberry preserves, or the controversial truffle oil (which Pepin wisely hints, only contains the "essence" of truffles), jarred alcaparrado, pre-cut lobster tails, salsa, you will wisely cut down on your time by using one or two bought, pre-made items. Also, it helps to pre-prepare some of the ingredients to your fast food, whether it be pre-cut, pre-rinsed onions (to rid it of sulfuric acid), chicken stock, or lamb stew cubes.Keep in mind however, that a big contributing factor to the "fast" in Pepin's fast food is the instructor himself. Head chef to France's president de Gaulle, resume entries from Howard Johnson to the Russian Tea Room, departmental dean of New York's French culinary institute, and cooking professionally for over 60 years, this is also the man who can famously remove every bone from a chicken with merely a slash..AND keep the whole chicken intact... in 20 seconds. As long as you understand this, you won't feel set back when you have to account for just a tad little additional time in the preparation of Pepin's "Fast Foods." Still, consider the time well-spent, because you will definitely be able to dazzle your guests in both taste and presentation. An added treat is seeing some of his complete techniques being demonstrated in practice.Now, a little about Pepin's personality. All great artists train us not only to enjoy beauty in life, but also to find new ways of seeing beauty in our surroundings. Pepin's Masters degree in French poetry certainly contributes to his delight when he comments on the beauty of pieces of vegetables and fruits or his crystalline observation that "the recipe is only the expression of the moment," a comment that instantly aligns cooking with jazz improvisation. His eye for proportion and balance in composition is evident even down to the way he tops a tomato with a garnish or cuts a skirt steak to show you the insides: it's almost painting with food. Yet his instructions are casual and his gentle resonant voice is warm and inviting. Pepin sips coffee or wine at the beginning or end of the shows, adding to the welcoming atmosphere. At one point, you can even hear the film crew chuckling when he winks at the camera and says, "don't tell the guest I ate half his egg."You may be able to watch some of these shows online. But with the dvds' crisp sound quality (the sizzle of a sautee, the knock of knife on chopping block, and of course the instructor's voice) and excellent resolution and definition, the sensual and beautiful pleasures of cooking is a delightful gift from Jacques Pepin and his way.
If you are looking for1. Connecting multiple electrical devices in the car/van etc without having a cigar lighter connector for every device2. Compact equipment to charge your batteries3. Using laptops, cellphones, lights, charge camera/camcorder4. Using it from cigar lighter and Battery directlyHere you have a simple,Cheap and effective solution. This worked for me good. My daughter loved it when she could use her laptop in the van during our 4 hours long drive last time. She could watch DVD, play games etc without any stopping for charging the battery etc...I liked this product and the price was good too.
Sure, the photographs look nice on big glossy oversized spreads... But I have to consider the message of the book, as loosely given in the text that introduces, accompanies, and then summarizes this collection of photos. Although the book will likely impress and inform readers about cultural diversity, unfortunately the text tries to claim how amazingly similar all these patterns are. It tries at every turn to introduce mystical elements and bases this whole approach on an interpretation of psychologist Carl Jung's conception of archetypes and the "collective unconscious." It is really too bad that the editor and commenters were so limited in their approach - tending toward the poetic rather than the analytic - for this book could have served as an introduction to the principles of cultural diffusion, history, culture areas, and other anthropological and sociological concepts and principles. Instead of looking at how the people of Madagascar had travelled from Southeast Asia, or (sometimes forceful) patterns in the spread of the "world religions" caused replacement or hybridization with traditional religions, or how the similarities in indiginous religions are rooted in the similar levels of technology and societal size/type (foragers, horticulturalists, agriculturalists, etc.); this book instead would suggest that similarities between its hand-picked photographs are supposed to show the existence of either God or a collective unconscious. It would have helped for the book to provide a clear definition of the "collective unconscious" that can actually fit in with modern understandings of cultural diffusion, memetics, social systems and cultural evolution. But it didn't; and so there was a large opportunity missed to reveal one of the truly remarkable cultural advances of modern times; that of rational and cumulative scientific endeavors. This book will instead only impress with the proneness of humanity to cling to the irrational. Instead of just a couple of quotes from Jung and Joseph Campbell, this book desperately needs quotations from Freud and Durkheim! Instead, this large tome addresses things at the same level as your average travelogue tv show. It whets the appetite and even feeds you a bit, but the "food" turns out to be candy rather than meat.
I love hot and sour soup and will order it every time i'm at a chinese restaurant. i've been to many chinese restaurants from the cheap hole in the wall to the really upscale. Rarely have I had a hot and sour soup that I didn't like. This soup was NOT at all like any hot and sour soup you will have ever had at a chinese restaurant. So I was pretty disappointed.
Purchased this printer about 3 years from Comp USA. The in-store display printed wonderfully replicated photos. I spent several hundred dollars on this printer and was excited to not have to send out my digital files for printing whenever I wanted just 1 or 2 photos.I admit I was stupid - at the first sign of trouble I should have taken this piece of junk back to the store. Prints regularly had ink stripes up the back which would smear all over print. Also, this problem would regularly occur and would streak to the front of the printed photo. I called Epson and they were no help whatsoever. They told me to manually wipe off the excess ink between prints so that this would not occur -- this was not a realistic solution and was a good indicator of their poor customer service and lack of solutions for flaws with their product.Photos rarely printed well. There would often be streaks and horizontal lines thru my printed photos.There are constantly warbly lines thru just about anything I attempt to print. I've wasted SO many color cartridges just trying to get 1-2 decent prints from photos. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!I've run every single tool for this printer, from cleaning the heads to checking nozzles, etc. I can't believe what a pain it is to simply print a single black and white text page, too.Paper jams were a common problem as well. Also - paper would feed in at an angle and therefore, printed items were often slightly crooked. I've only gotten a handful of good quality prints from this thing.So, after 3 years of headaches, I gave this junk away (for free) and went with a Dell all in one printer, which printed excellent quality photos. I will never buy Epson again.
I'm not going to write a synopsis of this particular book for you since it has been done by other reviewers and done so very well. What I am going to tell you is that if you do pick up this book you will most likely do as I did and have to get the rest. You will feel a need to devour them and find out just how Kate can live in such a inhospitable place (if you don't know what you are doing) These books which are a combination of police procedural and mystery (later books have a tiny tad of romance, but not in the typical way) that feature one of the strongest women protagonists I have ever read about. During this series Kate will suffer adversity like you may never have read about before and there is even one book that very nearly made me give up on the series because it was just so harrowing. But I promise you your curiosity will get the best of you and you WILL go back!With this the first novel in the Kate Shugak series, we learn enough about why Kate has come back to Niniltna . She seems to be in hiding and licking some wounds. But reading the entire series is the only way to get the fullest view of why she is the way she is. Sometimes cranky, quick to judge (yet almost always right) loving, sexy, strong of body and soul and a friend you really want at your back.This is a fascinating read for anyone that dreams of going to Alaska and a special cautionary tale for those that dream of moving there and living nowhere near a big city.Kate suffers from a Grandmother and 'Aunties' that wants her in a more traditional role of the modern Aleuts, while fighting for the Native's rights to land, money, aid etc. But Kate will do what is right and correct - for her while taking a serious stance on what she comes to think of as her 'people' - those who are her friends and family. Don't mess with Kate, she gets even. And especially don't mess with her during "break-up" when the back of winter is finally broken and the river starts thawing!
Find a used second edition. In good shape, because you will wear it out.Probably the most useful reference for a writer in addition to a goodstyle manual. Not just the what but the why - with wonderful examples.
I've been using this daily for 3 months now and have to say that there really is nothing I don't like about it. The previous 4- and 5-star reviews say it all, I would only be repeating, but I just wanted to add that one more person thinks that this is a great coffeemaker.You can order the water filter pods (only, no plastic "cage" and handle) from the HB website BUT I ordered them from partstown.com. Their shipping cost was horrible (almost $14 for a 9-3/8 ounce package shipped ground UPS from 2 states away...) but it was still less than HB because I ordered 8 pods. Do the comparison before ordering replacements, you may save some money.
sting, steve hillage (gong), mike howelet(producer) and nik turner(hawkwind) are here.only 5 songs 1 and 5 are really the same song.buy it if you are a sting completist.great package job!....as for the music....ahhhh thats another story. track 1 and 5 get by, the rest don't :-)...this cd should Be filed UNDER STING !
This book is a pleasure to read, especially for fans of romance. And for fans of Chic Lit. And for fans of funny, witty dialogue full of a surprising amount of social commentary and wisdom for the modern woman. This wonderfully original slant on the old fairy tale examines the barriers we erect for ourselves to stop us from really falling in love. The genius of this book is that it comes back to touch you when you're least expecting it, and you realize how true-to-life Crusie's recipe for love can be!
well, it's my first return to Amazon, followed by my second. This kettle blows steam out the edges of that big opening right onto the handle. Picking it up is risky business. It leaks water. I used to have a Revere kettle I loved, this one is nothing like it.
When I first got it I was disappointed to see how short the handle was. Until I went to use it. Considering how you hole the zester and use your thumb support on the lemon this design is perfect.Very happy with it. The rubber handle helps to give a good purchase on the lemon with out sliding around your hand.
After two months of light use, small spots of rust appeared through the black, vinyl coated wire. Another two months and the dishrack was leaving rusty stains on any dish it touched. My first thought was that this flaw was an isolated one, considering the company RUBBERMAID used to be. When I called the company directly, the rep said, "it happens" and offered a check of 10.00 toward the purchase of another. Eight weeks later...no check...no response from Rubbermaid. So buy their products with the knowledge you're buying junk, and the company is laughing all the way to their bank, which is probably overseas. Good Luck!
I was heartbroken when it was cancelled and became a huge fan of directv when they picked it up for season 3...BUT I just read on [...] (which is linked to Amazon) that they are releasing only the shortened/edited NBC season 3 - not the full episodes aired on directv's Channel 101. AND changing the music for the dvds.Basically, the fans and directv saved this show - and NBC is going to shaft the fans-AGAIN- by releasing shortened episodes instead of full directv episodes. I'm SOOOOOOOOOOOOO MAD. How much more could it really cost to release the entire episodes? And something has to be done to negotiate use of the music up front because fans of all shows usually love the music that was originally chosen by the original creative forces behind the show - rather than after the fact, haphazard changing the music to save money. If you are willing to spend $30 on season 3 (or buy it on sale) - you would probably spend $40 just as easily to get the full episodes with the real music.What a racket! I usually hate 1 star reviews that have nothing to do with the show - but the way it was released(like a volume 1 etc. just to make money) but when the way it is being released means you have no access to the full episodes on dvd-I think it deserves 1 star because it is content related. At least with a volume 1, they may be squeezing you for money but you know you have the option to buy volume 2 and get the entire season. This way, you just get edited episodes - with no hope of full episodes.By the way, it also said there would be a season 4&5 - YAHOO!!
I had really liked some of Doctorow's previous works especially Ragtime, so was anxious to check out his newest work which sounded intriguing. I got the audio book edition, as I usually enjoy listening to these in the car to occupy/save time. Unfortunately I for one was very disappointed in this one. Too much stream of consciousness and random thoughts. Little plot and no involving characters. Couldn't even finish it.
This is my favorite book by Judith M. Riley. I didn't think much of her first book, but I have found that this author has improved with every book. I loved all the characters; they were interesting as well as entertaining. It some aspects, the book had a little "sillyness" thrown about, but this only increased the fun of this book. The way people act in ordinary life is strange- it is fitting that they be just as strange in books! And the little bits of sillyness (I love when the Banker Montavert addresses menander as "monsieur evil head") are perfect bits of surrealism. This book is excellent, truly excellent
Review of lens based on Canon 40D:Be sure you can return it because the first one I got was pure junk. All of the images at 70mm f2.8 where unusably blurry.But wait... after returning it to Amazon (which was quick, return shipping paid, and pain free!!) for another copy of the lens it is very sharp and I would consider it acceptable for any amateur as well as professionals on a budget(such as myself).That being said, I should mention that there is a bit more chromatic aberration than I have seen from other lenses but it's acceptable and can be minimized with smart shooting.CONCLUSION:Don't be scared of the lens but do be sure you can return without hassle. All-in-all I am extremely happy with the results of the second lens.
Don't buy this garbage. It smells bad and it looks like you are just spray painting your head. It's exactly like spray paint except spray paint stays in one area and this garbage goes everywhere. The spray does not stay on your head too long, even if you apply your own hair spray holder. It is very messy. I had residue all over my face, hands, arms, and anything else around me. It just makes you very dirty and you definitely notice it when you shower it all away. When you tilt your head, tiny fragments of the spray fibers will fall everywhere and makes you look like you have a very bad dandruff problem. If you want to have dirty fingernails and embarass yourself and want to know what it feel like to survive an oil spill, use this product.
You know those nights when you're at the video store, and it seems like you've a) seen everything b) only things you haven't seen are movies you couldn't be paid enough to watch? Tonight was one of those nights.Fortunately, I remembered hearing that Liev Schreiber's directorial debut film, 'Everything Will Be Illuminated' was a worthwhile watch. I had been hesitant to watch it because, frankly, the cover image creeped me out, making me think of Elijah Wood's gruesomely freaky character in 'Sin City' - a strange and unfortunate cover choice for this movie.The film was actually superb, and the cover was indeed ill-chosen, for it reflected none of the lovely naturalism of the film itself. Elijah Wood plays a young man, who collects things that remind him of his family. After his grandfather passes, he travels to Ukraine to attempt to find the Shtetl his grandfather left only a week before the Nazi occupation. I don't want to say anything more about the plot, not to ruin the discovery for anyone who hasn't seen it.In short, the movie is artfully and deftly crafted - the director's touch seems so light, one feels like events are really unfolding. The actors, who are all excellent, never seem to be 'acting', and the script is not the usual heavy-handed let's-spoon-feed-and-finger-point-to-our-audience schlock. Schreiber lets the unspoken speak louder than words, and captures the fragile and vivid emotions of his characters. I've always said that the mark of a good writer is that he treats all his characters with tenderness--the entire movie is created with just such love and beauty of spirit. There is even a wonderful dog, "Sammy Davis Jr., Jr.," who is a storyteller in her own right, played by Mickey and Mouse, top dog actors if you ask me.So some night when you wonder which movie you should get, take this one. It is all-round exquisite.
The kids love this, it was a big hit. I would recommend to anyone. I was very satisfied with my purchase. I bought it to match my daughter's sheets. It goes well, and it very sturdy. Love these pillow cases.
This little Cave In single is great (except for it's short lifespan. I wish they had released an EP with at least 4 songs instead of just two, but it will do. Cave In have always been amazing and unique artists and this is just a little showcase of their talent. Especially, on &quot;Lift Off&quot; which will be on repeat for awhile. I suggest buying it, but try someplace where it's a little cheaper. No matter how good, almost 6 bucks (not including shipping) is too much. But this CD is still top-quality.
I came across this CD in a local dance music store. It was a rarity indeed. It was only meant for release in Australia, but it somehow managed to make its way to Washington, DC. I really enjoyed this CD. CD 1 was mixed by Paul Jackson (who I believe was a Ministry of Sound resident DJ at the time) and is just about as house as you can get. Funky and soulfoul with great tracks like &quot;Got the Funk&quot;, &quot;Funk Music&quot; and of course there is Joey Negro's &quot;Can't Get High Without You&quot;. This is one of the best house tracks ever and it put the Subliminal record label on the the map. David Morale's &quot;Needin U&quot; also stands out. CD 1 continues to go strong until &quot;Take Control&quot;. Can someone say cheese? Not one of my favorite house tracks. &quot;Take Control&quot; is one of those tracks that make non-dance music fans look their noses at us.However, the gift of this compilation is CD 2. Mixed by Australian DJ Jayse Knipe, it is includes a variety of dance tracks. Knipe doesn't stick to one genre like his counterpart on CD 2. CD 2 is also darker and less soulful than CD1. Danny Tenaglia's &quot;Elements&quot; is a gem which blends nicely into Mel Ween's &quot;The King.&quot; This is my favorite track on the entire CD. Martin Luther King's famous speech, &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; backed up by a hard-pumping progressive house beat takes the speech to another level. The music seems to enhance and magnify the speech's message. And of course, &quot;Three Drives on Vinyl&quot; stands and Medway's &quot;Engage&quot; is probably my favorite trance track. This was the track that introduced me to the genre in the first place. And the CD ends on a positive note with Paul van Dyk's &quot;Words (for Love). Definitely one of Paul's great accomplishments.This CD is definitely worth getting. However, be prepared to deal with the vastly different approaches from the two DJ's on this compilation. It lacks the continuity that is present on most double CD compilations (even those mixed by two or more different DJs). Yet, it's still a great CD to own.
I would admit, it's a bit too expensive, but overall a great product. My only (persona;) complaint that the led light is way too bright, it lit my whole room which was no longer dark at night. I had to put a patch on the light and it doesn't bother me anymore.
As the five stars indicate, this is as good as it gets. Fits the hose well with no leaks and puts out a good strong narrow blaster stream. Thank goodness they haven't converted to the rot-away brass colored pot metal that we see in so many hose fittings.
Leave it to a Westerner to dumb-down Daoism. It can happen in the East without our help.This is a cute book and could have been a fun read if I didn't understand philosophical Daoism.Let me say that I'm glad that folks love Winnie and company. I do too. I think the characters are great but Daoism doesn't describe them or their lot.The problem with oversimplification is that it ignores and perhaps disparages, deeper values to be realized.Modern Western process philosophy has been coming around to the value of Daoism's ontology and metaphysics for years now, and to reduce these values to Winnie the Pooh is not helpful.I apologize if this offends anybody but just as we tend to make God and/or Jesus sound too much like Santa Claus, the referents are so much more than our fundamentalist beliefs of them.
I purchased the camera as a gift for my husband in July of 2002. As new parents, we expected that we would want a camcorder to record important moments in our children's infancy and toddlerhood. We have not been able to do so, as the camera has been out of commission or in the repair shop for most of the time we've owned it.In September of 2003, after approximately 15 total hours of normal use, significant digital noise / pixel distortion and a "head cleaning required" message began to appear. We followed the prescribed procedure and cleaned the video heads with a MiniDV cleaning tape. The problem was not corrected, so we sought repair of the camcorder (to the tune of $240). A rebuild of the drum assembly, supply and takeup reels was performed by a JVC-authorized repair center.Since then, we have recorded less than two hours of tape, and the digital noise problem has again reappeared. Some research suggests that we are not the only ones who have had this difficulty with our JVC camcorder. Since my difficulties, I have found hundreds of consumer comments that suggest that this and several other models of JVC digital camcorders and DV recorders are riddled with digital noise problems.I have never been so dissatisfied with such a major purchase and am currently seeking a full refund from JVC. Wish me luck.
I agree with most reviewers that From Russia With Love is one of the best Bond movies but I was very disapointed that contrary to the cover claiming that it was a widescreen version it was full screen. I have the Criterion laserdisc which is widescreen and although the laserdisc is supposedly lower in resolution than the DVD I believe the laser is better. The extras with the DVD are nice but the screen format was a BIG disappointment! This refers to the 007 Volume 3 DVD which I assume is the same as the one listed here.
Hip-Hop producer/vet proves to still be in the game with this top-notch, long awaited, anticipated sequel to his impressive solo debut &quot;Soul Survivor.&quot; This time around, Pete lays his rhyming skills aside to focus more strictly on his production.Several of the guest performers on the album are sub-mainstream artists, speakably Talib Kweli, Pharoah Monch, Slum Village etc., who each give avid efforts to shock and amaze. Some tracks which feature the less known artists are plain out amazing, such as the ones featuring Leela James, Krumbsnatcha, and Little Brother. For they present Pete at some of his best production to date.One noticeable aspect that fans may witness is the abscense of Pete's DJ and mixing skills. There are absolutely none found throughout the album (a huge aspect which made Soul Survior 1 so memorable) so some Pete Rock fans (many of whom have grown fond of his mixing since the days of &quot;Mecca &amp; The Soul Brother&quot;) may find it as a shock to know that there are none in SS2.Lyrically, the album is impressive (you'd expect nothing less involving the Soul Brother #1) with some dope rhymes. The only tracks that I really wasn't feelin' were the ones with Postaboy, Dead Prez, and Jay Dilla. The tracks featuring Postaboy &amp; Dead Prez just sound too commercial for their own good, and lyrically aren't very impressive. As for the track with Jay Dilla (Jay Dee) he makes as a great producer, but a not-so-great MC (check out his &quot;Welcome To Detroit&quot; lp to get a better understanding) the track is also fairly short, clocking in at around two minutes. The track just felt rushed.All in all Soul Survior II (while productive-wise, not Pete's best work) is a decent follow-up to SSI and also a breath of fresh air aside from the mainstream hip-hop music scene. Four Stars.
Didn't use it due to late shipment. Seemed to be an ok product though. Would recommend higher if received sooner
This film actually put me to sleep. I watched the "Road to Passchendaele" feature on the DVD and it seemed to go on forever. One thing is quite clear and that is Paul Gross seems very fond of himself and his abilities. The film is heavy-handed and slow. It alternates between battle scenes and scenes on the homefront. I never believed the far-fetched romance with the Canadian nurse nor her brother with asthma who manages to enlist and winds up being looked after by Gross's character of Sergeant Mann, ala Saving Private Ryan. Yes, the battle scenes are gruesome and well filmed. It is just that the rest of the film is not on a par with the action scenes. I much more enjoyed The Red Baron and Flyboys. Perhaps maybe if Paul Gross had not tried to dominate every possible part of this film the results might have been better. The actual events on which this film is based were very significant and the Canadian forces made a great sacrifice and contribution. It is just a pity that this was not more obvious than Mr. Gross trying to carry the film solely by himself. He should at least have left the writing of the screenplay to someone more capable and objective. Then he would have been left with only top-star billing, directing and executive producing. Has anyone outside of Canada ever heard of Paul Gross before or since this film was made anyway??
You wouldn't think a book about a nuclear excursion could be witty and snappy, yet scientific -- but this book is. It is also well-researched.I tore through this book in a couple of nights -- I could not put it down. The author was able to mix science with dramatic, true-crime style writing which made the pages fly by.I had never heard of this disaster, and I am surprised more people don't know about it. This book is worth the money, if only to educate yourself about how the government could run a reactor that is falling apart and is controlled by ONE control rod. Hellloooo??At the end of the book, the choice is yours about what to believe happened -- I liked it that the author left it up to the reader. Good, old-fashioned solid writing with a little bit of "flash" (no pun intended).
