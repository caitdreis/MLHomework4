I don't know why, but Flexaril just isn't doing the trick for me anymore. I'm shocked by how well this product works for muscle spasms, I suppose the Valerian and passiflora which are also mental relaxants along with the magnesium for the cramping help give you that over all feeling of "ahhh." I know not everything works for everyone and it's a relatively expensive purchase if it doesn't. If you're need of one of their other vitamins, order those and they'll send along a free trial of the Valerin and you can find out for yourself. That's how I got to experience it, I ordered their cinnamon for blood sugar support and got the sample.I also take the Valerin at night with Schiff Melatonin Plus, total relaxation comes swiftly and long vivid dreams follow. (a side effect of melatonin I really enjoy) I like this product so much I've been passing it out like a pusher telling people, try this it's awesome!
Not the most innovative concept in marketing, but Galdwell did a very good job in explaining a complex phenomena by giving easy to follow examples. I particularly like the Boston Tea Party example.
These being used, I feel i'll need to replace the battery in one of the handsets (not as good reception/short battery life). But it was a bargain and my previous phone had really kicked off with no chance of return.
Up front, spend a little more and get a Lint Lizard. This thing is a cheap knock-off.For starters, it wouldn't fit on my standard household vacuum cleaner. To make it fit, I had to slit a spot in the attachment to make it fit. After struggling with it, I finally hooked it up to my shop-vac and it fit perfectly.To give you the general idea of how disappointing this is, I needed it to clean my dryer which has been out of service for several days due to lint build-up. Living on a gravel road in the country, things get dustier than normal, meaning more regular cleaning. Once the shop-vac was fired up, I attempted to clean the dryer vent.As long as you're going straight in, it does pretty well. Once you start bending the hose to catch those nooks and crannies, it kinks up and loses suction. This is NOT helpful at all. I finally managed to get it to do what was needed after fussing and fuming with it. In the meantime, the stupid thing got stuck down in the dryer vent and I cut my hand to pieces trying to dig it out.A Lint Lizard isn't the greatest thing since sliced bread but it sure beats this little ditty!
These are not high end knives with layers and layers of paint or varnish and the price reflects that. Where else can you get four riveted wooden handled spreading knives at this price?My knives came individually wrapped in plastic. The serrations on these knives are very aggressive. I wash them carefully because I'm afraid I might take a chunk out of my flesh. I usually do my spreading using the smooth non serrated side of the blade. The varnish on the wood is a bit thin but I oiled the handles with mineral oil and they are holding up great.If your knives arrive with stickers on the handles as some reviewers mentioned (mine did not) then use goo gone to remove the stickers instead of soaking in water. Never soak wooden ware or utensils with wood handles. If you properly care for wood it will last a lifetime. Hand wash, rinse and dry immediately. Rub mineral oil on the wood once a month or as needed.
Thank to Gigi for keep the Italian romantic style alive. Great CD and song selection to listen in the car, while jogging or having romantic evening with your mate.
My son loves this book, perhaps because it goes through an entire day in the life of toddlers, and he sees so many things that are familiar to him. The kids eat breakfast, get dressed, play, take naps, have baths, and get stories read at bedtime. He loves following the children through their day. We read this one every night.
Not only is the price of this disc reasonable, but it would be worth it at retail. Twenty-one classic oldies from the sixties, all sounding better than they ever have before, at a good price. I can't imagine a better deal! This cd contains some of the hard to find hits like, &quot;My Boy Lollipop&quot; by Millie Small, &quot;Laurie&quot; by Dickie Lee, and &quot;Rumors&quot; by Johnny Crawford, in addition to first-time releases of &quot;Witchi Tai To&quot; by Everything Is Everything, the stereo single versions of &quot;Sailor&quot; by Lolita, Jo Ann Campbell's &quot;A Kookie Little Paradise&quot;, &quot;(Just Like) Romeo and Juliet&quot; by The Reflections, Miriam Makeba's &quot;Pata Pata&quot;, and the mono single version of &quot;Master Jack&quot; by Four Jacks and a Jill! In short, it's flawless, and is a must-have for anyone who loves sixties oldies.
For anyone who has to take an elevator at home or at work, you can't tell me that you've never thought about what it would be like to be stuck in an elevator. I have and it's something that's always on my mind everytime I step into one. Chances are, most people have been stuck at least once. It's scary even though you logically know that you're going to get out. I won't quite compare an elevator ride to flying or taking the subway but it is a form of transportation and you have little control until the big box that encapsulates you decides to open and releases you. Luckily, 99.9% of the time it does.Basically, we have a skyscraper office building and three men and two women "randomly" board the ill fated elevator. On the 30th floor or so they realize they are stuck as the elevator jolts and ceases to move. Immediately building security that monitors the elevators is aware that they have a stuck elevator and puts a man on the job of getting them unstuck. What should be an easy procedure becomes challange after challange as attempts to rescue them are thrwarted by seemingly normal mishaps.A big problem is that building security can see them and speak to them but the trapped passengers cannot be heard. A detective who is a couple months sober happens to be in the vicinity, investigating a suicide jumper from the skyscraper building where the stuck elevator is. The detective is brought into the building because as the lights flicker on and off, one of the five is dead so the other four quickly become suspicious of each other. There was very little character development but that's okay. The storyline that the devil is supposed to be in the elevator and could be any one of them is almost incidental; for me it was all about being in a trapped elevator with no apparent way out. This movie was strangely satisfying and I enjoyed it but when I go back to work tomorrow, I'll take the stairs.
In case no one's told you yet, &quot;Brazil&quot; is a really great film. I can think of no other movie that has stuck with me so vividly, for so many years, after only one viewing.That's right, despite the fact that I consider &quot;Brazil&quot; one of the greatest films of all time, I've only seen it once, and have no plans ever to see it again. The visuals are rich, with bizarrely Orwellian settings, the performances were brilliant, the writing superb, and despite all that, or perhaps because of it, I can't make myself go through it again.&quot;Brazil&quot; manages to be both deeply depressing and funny at the same time. The story centers on a man who works in an administrative position at the Bureau of Information Retrieval, an enormous agency whose job it is to spy on people, invading their lives and torturing them as needed, all in an effort to &quot;stop terrorism&quot;. Adding insult to injury, the Bureau then bills its torture victims for its &quot;Information Retrieval&quot; costs incurred while conducting its investigations.It becomes painfully clear in the course of the film that these putative efforts to stop terrorism are meaningless. The terrorists, if there were any in the first place, have become nothing but an excuse for oppression. The government has a strange way of responding instantly to any terrorist act, as if they knew it was going to happen beforehand.Despite the grim setting and even grimmer events that transpire, &quot;Brazil&quot; nonetheless remains entertaining, absurdly funny, and even occasionally (for brief periods, anyway) uplifting. I think most people will gain something from watching this film at least once, Once may even be enough.
Years ago, I replaced my regular home phone with VoIP but now it looks like I'll be replacing my home VoIP phone too! This Nokia N95 *is* my VoIP phone when I'm home! AND... I can take it with me everywhere I go.You can be anywhere in the World and as long as you have a WiFi connection, your phone numbers will be active for incoming and outgoing VoIP calls. I say "phone numbers" because with VoIP you can have multiple international numbers ring on the same phone. i.e. I have a Miami number, a London UK number and a Caribbean phone number all ring on the same Nokia N95 phone. How? You need a good VoIP provider that offers multiple numbers on the same account (called DID's).Throw all your other phones away!!! Seriously - but give yourself a couple of weeks first to get acquainted with this phone. It's different from handling a Blackberry... both physically and operationally. It took me a couple of weeks to get used to it - in fact, it was a week before I took it for a walk outside the house :) It's just a few ounces in weight and it feels very delicate - like it might break or drop. But that's only because I was used to handling a Blackberry which is much bulkier and heavier.VoIP guys - Bear in mind that you MUST install a SIM chip to get the phone working properly - without the SIM chip, the phone goes into "off line" mode and it basically impossible to get it to do anything. i.e. you can't get the VoIP working if the SIM chip isn't installed.Of course, there's so many other features like GPS, Camera, etc... there's a pretty steep learning curve but it's definitely worthwhile!Give yourself enough time and you'll fall in love with this phone!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
I will state right now that this book is not, IMHO, an easy read, or a particularly fluid read.However, it is very informative, containing much information about the natural habits and ecology of varanid lizards. My main complaint is that the book seems to use V. rosenbergi as it's archetypal varanid; there are some 9 sub genera and several dozen species, and I wish that more attention had been payed to the some of the other varanids. However, this is still one of the few good monitor books that's actually in print, and is worth your read weather you're an academic herpetologist or a keeper (or for that matter if you are thinking about keeping a monitor). It provides insights that are sorely lacking in most other (in print) books, espically in regards to the thermal biology, water useage, and the diet of these lizards. It's easily worth your effort to read it.The discussions about taxonomy are also great, and informative in regards to how gene sequencing is being used to establish relationships and derivations between species.
Guy Montage is a fireman. But he doesn't stop houses from burning down. He starts the fire. They light the houses with books on fire, becuase books are considered bad. Not all books, but some, like the Bible, and any book containing thought. Books like porn, and goverment writings were premited. This is how the goverment at the time controled the people. By not letting them learn.Montage meets his new next door neighbor. Her name is Clairesse. Which in Spainish means clarity. And she does live up to her name. She makes Montage think for the first time. She asks him the most simple question, that can also be the most difficult. &quot;Are you happy&quot;. Montage thinks about this and realizes that he isn't. he wife trys to comit suicide, and she lives in a alter reality. SO he turns to his &quot;enemy&quot;, books.He starts to wonder what is in the books that he burns. And he realizes that he has been stealing books all the time he has been a fireman. So he gets the illegan books and starts to read them. The he goes to an old professer and they hatch a plan to re-print these books.Durring this time Montage has to face his fireman captain, Beatty. He also knows that the goverment is bad for holding the knowledge back, that is in books. But unlike Montage, he is doing nothing about it.Through out this book there are glimpses of the people, who like Montages wife, are clueless. Montage yells at woman who only care about the &quot;family&quot;, a TV show that lets you interact with the characters. Then he finds that it is his house that is to be burned down. And that he has to light the match.Montage goes through many stages in this book. He starts like a new born baby, not used to the world that he is in. He grows as the book goes along. From a newborn to a fifteen year old child. Just exploring the world, and startign to make a change.
I have enjoyed Morrow's work for some time, however this is a breakthrough novel. He grabs you and won't let go. It is a book that is both profane and profound. Bravo!
I'm a fan of low budget or B Horror from the 70's and 80's, but not a great fan of Italian Horror, I got this pack thinking it would be super cheesy and laughable, and these movies have there moments, but overall Zombie3 and 4 (haven't watched 5 yet) turned out to be right entertaining and had what I consider a lot of blood and gore. I was also surprised to find the prints were quite good, not excellent but far above the typical value set, and there were lots of extras including interviews and commentary. Obviously these are not the best zombie movies ever made, but they are far from the worst, I enjoyed them, and I'm happy to have them in my collection.
I bought a box of the Prismacolor Col-Erase blue pencils and a box of the Ticonderoga erasable blue checking pencils.Both pencils write clearly. However, the Prismacolor blue pencils are much better because their blue color is darker; more of a navy blue. The Ticonderoga's blue is lighter; more of a sky blue color.From now on, I'm going to buy the Prismacolor Col-Erase Erasable Colored Pencils, 12 Blue Pencils (20044). The Ticonderoga blue pencils are not dark enough.
I am SO glad I purchased this...boy, the memories it brought back of laughing at Ma and Pa's antics with my grandparents when I was a kid!!! The quality of the films is excellent, from the picture to the sound. The actors are some of the best that the world has ever been blessed to have had!Now my children are enjoying them with me, laughing at Ma and her huge brood, comparing them to me coming from a rambunctious family of ten! They couldn't believe though that she could do this with 15 kids and a lazy-bones like Pa!!!It's so refreshing to be able to have hours of entertainment that's actually funny without resorting to any crassness that's so pervasive in movies of our current era. For anyone who wants to have a wonderful trip down memory lane or who wants to see what good, clean entertainment with marvelous acting looks like, I would highly recomment this set as well as the next volume!
I am not usually a player of Resident Evil games. I played them and thought they were pretty damn good, but nothing I would get hyped up over. This game changed my perspective on RE games, but what a game could be. This game is SO HARD. It's one of those games where you say, "I've been playing this for 2 hours, why not try for another 2." I'm not too far in the game yet, but the enemies are not normal. They are so smart. Let's put it this way:If the enemies in this game had guns, you'd be !@#$ed!!!! You die SO FRIGGIN' FAST. That's what makes it fun to play. It's set aside from any other game i've played. One reason why: In any other game, when someone kills you with a chainsaw, a little blood flies, you go into a slow motion fall, and it plays sad music. NOT THIS GAME. I was standing there reloading my Shotgun, when a large man with a chainsaw was coming at me. As I pulled up to fire, he quickly put his chainsaw against my neck. My first thoughts were, "greate, now I get to see the bad graphics of the game." Yeah, I was wrong. To make a long story short: When my guy hit the ground, he hit it without a head on his shoulders.--GRAPHICS= 12/10 (yes, I wrote 12)--SOUND= 10/10--GAMEPLAY= 12/10 (yes, I mean 12 again)--KICK ASS FACTOR= 34/30WARNING: DUE TO THE EMENSE AMOUNT OF GORE, EVERY CHILD SHOULD PLAY THIS GAME.
This book is written extreamely well. All ideas come across in the book without using any bad language. The author does not automatically assume the reader's attitudes / outlooks - she writes it objectively. She covers what she has advertised on the title - and even has a small vocabulary in the back [doesn't assume that the reader knows all of the abbreviations used in the book. The style the book is written in keeps interest - I read the 163 pages in one day.
GREAT bc there is not greasy film. Plus I do not like SPF in Mens products and Loreal has many GrEAT mens products at a REALLY GREAT PRICE !!
It's one thing having a 10,000 musical instrument, but it's another to manipulate sounds and make melodies out of it. After listening to this album once and loving almost every damn song, i cannot understand why the hell radio stations play rubbish like Enrique Igelesias and Kylie Monique (well Enrique screwed Anna Kornikova and Kylie is always half naked), and in the middle of that culture we live in, peoeple miss out on beautifully composed music from Frou Frou. I MUST SAY the lady in the CD sounds haunting. she has a lovely voice. only after watching garden state did i discover such a rare pop/synth talent such as this one. If you're a mid 20s like me, you'll love this album. and by the way, THIS REVIEW IS FROM SOMEONE WHO'S LISTENED TO NOTHING BUT ROCK AND CLASSIC ROCK ALL HIS LIFE!! thank you for such beautiful music.
For people who have never watched fairly clean movies then John Waynes will be a pleasure to watch. As all Wayne movies this is clean, simple, and good.
I'd loved all the other Jack Ryan stories I'd read (though I hadn't read all of them). This was a little too coarse and nowhere near as good as the earlier ones.
I will attest at the outset that I am far more of a pen snob than a mechanical pencil snob, but I still find I was quite disappointed by the Graph Gear 500 that I recently purchased. For some reason, these things seem to get an almost cult-like following and I really don't have a clue why that is, now that I've used one of them myself.It is a very basic, almost cheap looking mechanical pencil except for the grip and tip, which are actually metal. Even here, however, the metal is not finely made or turned on a lath so that it feels brushed, nor is it polished. No, instead, it looks and feels cheap, like pot metal. Were it not for the knurling on the grip, you would be hard pressed not to think this was hard "metal looking plastic" rather than actual metal. Perhaps worse is that in addition to looking cheap and feeling cheap, it's also horribly unbalanced in your hand. The grip and tip have far too much weight compared to the ultra-cheap plastic body, and it just makes it feel awkward in your hand. Another thing, the plastic they used for the body is so cheap and unfinished that you can actually see lines and striations of some sort through it's surface. I'm sorry, but that just screams "cheap" to the discerning user.I realize this pencil isn't *that* expensive, but you have put into perspective that what you're getting for the premium is just a crappy metal grip/tip section that does more harm than good to an already cheap looking pencil. It makes it more awkward to handle, to write with just plain isn't worth the money. There are much, much nicer mechanical pencils, much less drafting pencils, that will do the job a lot better and for a lot less coin.Stay away from this, either switch brands or upgrade to one of Pentel's better offerings. These are bottom of the line and it shows.
outstanding photography and personal approach to describing each village.One distraction is that although there are maps throughout the book it was difficult to match the photograph with accompanying name of village to the map. I had to search and search all over the map to find where the village was located. Of course if the maps had been gridded (ex. village at F4 on map) it would not have been as artistic but a heckuva a lot easier.The book I read was the softcover version from the library and the binding was coming apart. A personal copy would probably be less stressed.
No matter how I tried, I could not enjoy this book. I love ghost towns, ruins, sequestered villages and have logged many travel miles to visit them. This book should have been right up my cobblestone alley. Unfortunately, it is a very boring read. There isn't much description of the town beyond everything is crumbling and rotting away, there is no glimpse into the village's hey-day so we really have no sense of loss, just a drawn-out, really dull account of the last few years of the town. It's like listening to someone on his deathbed moan and groan for days on end until you know it would be a mercy for him to die. There's just no atmosphere, no nostalgia, no--as I said--genuine sense of loss.To top it all off, the book is full of dumb cliches (some cliches ARE dumber than others), like &quot;I was staring death in the face&quot; or &quot;death was laughing at me&quot;, etc. I really wondered how this thing made it into print. There's no story, not a hint of humor, no characters that come off the pages, really nothing to get attached to. I couldn't even read it all the way through although its not even 150 pages long and the type is BIG. All I can say is if you enjoy forlorn places, as I do, and you enjoy history brought to life--or at least to art--you will be really disappointed with this one.
The kindle kindles hatred in my heart. I want to use the kindle for kindling. This "reading device" is bound to be obsolete and forgotten within a few years. It does nothing that my laptop can't already do. I dont want to lug around my laptop and the stupid kindle as well. I could have just brought along a paperback instead and saved myself about 390$. I dont read dozens of books at a time and I dont know anyone who does. The kindle has a very short battery life, and it doesn't display illustrations, graphs, footnotes etc. so really this device is pretty much useless. but if you have to have every new tech gadget that comes along be my guest -it will be gathering dust in your closet along with your segway and your hd-dvd player sooner than you think.
While the few other Coriolis Exam Cram books I have used have been of good to excellent quality, I discovered when only a few questions into the Server+ exam that this particular book was almost completely useless. I did pass the exam, but with little help from this book. There are numerous typos (is that GB or MB?), inconsistencies, and straight-out errors. The actual content is barely relevant to the onslaught of experience-based troubleshooting questions on the exam. I gave this two stars instead of one because I do recall a couple questions (out of an eighty question exam) where my studying in the book actually did help me. I hate to give a Coriolis book a bad rating, seeing as how they've always released quality products in the past, but this book is just terrible in comparison.
I purchased one of these based on Amazon reviews only. I don't get how 'great' this is from other reviews. To each his own I guess. This is basically a bag of grain. It feels like a 50/50 mix of sand and crunchy rice. Save yourself a few bucks, go the the closest farmers market in your area and buy a bag of desiccated rice. Fill a pillow case with it and try it out. That's what this pillow is. Other reviewers say the crunching noise isn't a problem. With all due respect, they must suffer from hearing loss. Every little move of the head generates crunching noise. I tried using it for about five minutes before giving up. Lastly, pray this pillow never breaks open in your house. If you think the bean bag chairs of the 70's were a nightmare when they broke open, this pillow will set new standards in household aggravation.
True confession: Like Becky Bloomwood, I am raging shopaholic and have been one since I got my first credit card back in my freshman year of college. And like Becky, sometimes my bills are in the scary range. Unlike Becky, I haven't stuffed my credit statements into a trashcan or written creative letters to my creditors. But I would love to romp through her closets!Now onto the book. Becky Bloomwood is a single Londoner who works in publishing (yes, another one of THOSE). She may officially write for a magazine on sucessful saving and money management, but she truly spends more time in the shops, at press functions and in the image warehouse with her best work buddy &quot;selecting&quot; graphics for their magazines issues.While on the way to a press function, Becky gets waylaid by a sale sign at her favorite (and exclusive) accessories store. Using her wiles and a wild tale to hunky Luke Brandon, Becky gets the scarf of her dreams. Well at least the scarf she dreams of for the moment.But having the perfect scarf doesn't mean her life is in balance. Her bank manager wants to meet with her about her overdraft and her creditors are howling at the door. Her terrific flatmate offers to help but Becky can't bring herself to take advantage of the situation. Instead Becky decides to &quot;cut back&quot; and spend less with disasterous results.Will Becky ever pull herself out of debt? Maybe. Will she find a boyfriend? Perhaps. Will she manage to come out on top at the end of the day? Yes.For anyone who loves Marian Keyes or Wendy Holden, Sophie Kinsella is a must have.
this movie was great--gripping--edge of your seat--I never would have guessed the ending--great story and fantastic acting....a must have
Just follow the money trail, the political bantering and incessant self-victimization (which always seems to lead into getting paid one way or another) and you'll see why the most powerful of the jewish lobby (yeah, I'm not afraid to say it) will still ENDORSE IT after it has been proven to be a complete fabrication.And they wonder why the "extremists" have so much credibility even before people look at all the facts. I've read this book and got a great laugh out of the rediculous claims, and the writings of a man obviously an older version of someone whom would be on the Jerry Springer show today if faced with a different self-victimization issue.I was already well informed this book was a fabrication in advance, so I can't say "I'm smarter than you all whom were fooled"...heck, even Elie "Weasel" fooled me the first two times around. Looks like his credibility is crap as well. I'mglad I have relatives that were on both sides of WW2; as camp munitions auditor, fitness/activity trainer (A Sergeant's job! He was denied citizenship in US but later came from Canada in about '80), a Luftwaffe infantryman whom both stayed at the conc camps, and himself taken POW when wounded in Belgium (yes many Luft Inf exist so stop emailing me, you don't know history) and a US liberator of Buchenwald...I'm glad REALITY doesnt match the whining stories of crybaby rich jews exiled after the war...so many millions of survivors all rubber-stamping eachothers stories about human soap and lampshades, all proven false by MAINSTREAM science. Like I said, follow the money trail...
"Ex Machina" is one of the best Star Trek books I have read in a very long time. Christopher L. Bennett sets the time frame of this book within the relatively untouched area of time after the events of Star Trek: The Motion Picture and before the events in Star Trek: The Wrath Of Kahn. Along with (finally) finding out what really happened to the V'Ger/Willard Decker/Ilia life form, Mr. Bennett also shows us what became of the Fabrini race of the Star Trek: The Original Series episode "For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky". Mr. Bennett really knows his obscure Star Trek alien species, as well. Megarites, Betelguesians, Zaranites, Rhaandarites, Rigellians, Saurians, etc., all have sizeable and important roles in this novel (these aliens were only seen - blink and you'll miss them - in ST: TMP and Star Trek: The Voyage Home). You may want to brush up on your Star Trek: TOS episodic history a bit, for Mr. Bennett mentions events/characters that have been featured in many other Star Trek: TOS episodes. You may also want to consult the Star Trek: TOS novel series "The Lost Years" (especially the novel "A Flag Full of Stars") for characters/events mentioned in this book, as well. It is too bad that authors like Mr. Bennett are not writing for the latest incarnation in the ever-expanding Star Trek universe, Star Trek: Enterprise - Mr. Bennett could really take the Star Trek franchise to new creative heights.
Haggard was the first adventure fantasy writer and arguably the most prolific and the best. I first read these three stories over a summer in high school many years ago. I've re-read them so many times I've had to glue the book together with Elmer's glue. Read "She" again last week and just finished "Return of She", the entire book, in one night. Couldn't put it down. Some people (my kids) are turned off by the dated writing style of the "She" books and the way he handles dialogue, but Haggard adjusts his style to the material. "She", "Alan Quartermain", "Cleopatra", and "King Solomon's Mines" are written in different styles. I read Haggard because I am amazed at how he can draw you into the story and the characters. I know the story so well I can write it myself, yet I still become lost in it because it is written so well. The detail is amazing without being tedious. You begin to know the characters personally. When Quatermain decides to take his last safari after his son dies, you can feel what he is going through. I am an avid reader in all categories from quantum physics to poetry to science fiction and biographies and Haggard is in a class of his own. Anyone who enjoys adventure or wishes he/she had one will enjoy Haggard, especially these three books.
I use stickers as rewards for kids at work and when I look at a description that says LARGE ROUND stickers I expect what anyone would expect, something 2-3" in diameter. What I got was pages of stickers about the size of my thumb. They are cute but by no means are they LARGE.
I refused to see the theatrical release of this when I first heard of it .Because I knew there would be no way you can top a creepy idea like the original with Carol Kane .Now the origninal was a masterpiece in horror with the idea that someone is in the house calling the victim of course now days we have cell phones and caller ID and this simply cant happen .My suggestion is to rent first before you waste your money in owning this silly film .
I read a lot of books, and often I find myself thinking of things like what the cat's up to when really I should be paying attention to the words that are fleeing past my eyes. With this novel, Michel Faber has made me focus on every word. It is the most beautifully written novel I've read in a very long time, and my significant other can tell you how much of it I felt obliged to read aloud, just to share the beauty of the writing. The story is so deftly told that I felt as if I knew everyone involved, as if I really cared what happened. I was telling a friend about it just today, and it occured to me that the indignation I felt about some of the injustices in this book was just as real as if it had been a true story. I don't recall ever feeling as drawn in to a plot as I was with this superb book.
I'm really tired of hearing all the old-school Mup's fans dragging this album through the mud. Oh sure, it's different. Even 'slickly produced', if you had to. But... is 'different' a big surprise coming from Curt Kirkwood? I mean, the guy changes musical directions like Pete Townshend changes his mind. But, he almost never fails to bring a wonderful record to back up whatever his latest vision may be... and &quot;Golden Lies&quot; is no exception. Lots of other reviewers have hit the nail directly on the head concerning the individual tracks and overall sound, so I shant dwell on that too much. I can tell you this, though... it's an acquired taste. The record will not jump right out at you with it's indolent beauty all at once. Give it a few weeks.And try to forgive the band for the disappointing tour that followed this record's release. Blech.
I pieced together the series by purchasing both new and used copies. i can tell you it was was money well spent
Keith Lockhart has continued behind the heels of John Williams at the helm of the Boston Pops Symphony in extraordinary fashion since 1995. Anyone who has been privileged to see him conduct the orchestra can feel the enthusiasm he has for the orchestras's traditions and legacy- and for classical music. This theme certainly holds true for this CD. I always wanted a good set of songs for my 4th of July outdoor parties to help set the mood and this one delivers in grand style.All the "classics" one would expect to hear for the patriotic holiday are here: "The Star Spangled Banner" and "America The Beautiful" (the Tanglewood Festival Chorus singing the words to these two songs will give you chills), "The Overture of 1812" (I can almost "see" fireworks as BPO plays the finale), and "The Stars and Stripes Forever" (One cannot pass through the 4th of July without hearing one John Phillip Sousa song!!).The rest of the album is equally as entertaining with goodies such as "Boogie-Woggie Bugle Boy." Others will also rouse your patriotic fevor such as "Doodletown Fifers" (Fifes on the 4th? Of course!), and "America," (Paul Simon's wonderful song). One of my favorites is "With Voices Raised." The Boston Pops plays background as the Tanglewood Festival Chorus, The Boston Pops Choir, and the Boston Gay Men's Chorus sing and speak eloquent quotes from famous Americans as Abigal Adams, Martin Luther King, Walt Whitman, President John F. Kennedy, Fredrick Douglas, and Shirley Chisholm.I have collected five CD's that get playtime over Independence Day through the day and evening. Ever since I purchased "Splash of Pops," though, it seems to get a bit more airing each year. You'll be dazzled and feel proud, happy, and content everytime you listen to it.My only complaint with the import version of this CD is the price. The playlist is identical to the good ol' American RCA Victor CD, which is available at a substantially lower price.
Looking around for bands I think I'd like but never heard of before, I came across the New Young Pony Club. Their single, "Ice Cream" is included here. It, as well as so many other songs here, are eclectic bunch of funky post New Wave songs, in the vein of Franz Ferdinand. Very fun, dancy music, extremely electronic. Similar to Blondie, funkier than Berlin.I like this album collection a lot because it has such great music from bands I've never heard of before.For the record, my favorite "popular" music bands being Depeche Mode, Erasure, INXS, Soft Cell, Flock of Seagulls, OMD, Yaz, Sparks, Scritti Pollitti, Squeeze, Thompson Twins, Wham!, Nitzer Ebb, The Killers, and I've just recently discovered Beborn Beton and The Bravery.Volume 1 of this collection is also available on allofmp3 dot com.Walt D in LV
By now, its pretty clear the "$hrub" ain't the brightest guy in the world. The press tells us every day and Bush firmly backs it up most every time he opens his mouth.Whoever runs against Bush in 2004 could use this book to script a bunch of mudslinging ads that make up the "substance" of most elections these days. Over and over, this book tells us how stupid Bush is and how he favors the rich and lets people pollute. If you want to read a Bush-bashing book, this will fit the bill.Like the televised debates and most of the news media fodder on political issues these days, the intelligence of Bush is all but irrelevant (though the apparent lack of it doesn't help any) to the day to day or even long term strength and prosperity of the United States. Just because other candidates are probably intellectually superior to Bush doesn't mean much when they are all owned by the same companies seeking tax breaks, licenses to run sweat shops, "self regulation", and the freedom to dump any and all pollutants in somebody else's backyard.If you are interested in politics and the state of the US this is a book to consider reading, however, it exclusively airs the $hrub's dirty laundry and presents a very small part of the picture.To see a much more complete picture, pick up:"If The Gods Had Meant Us to Vote They Would Have Given Us Candidates" by Jim Hightower
Due to its multi-section arrangement, falling into three precise stages, this book feels like a well-paced coming-of-age novel, an impression buoyed by the fact that, to a degree that is unusual for politicians, Obama can actually write well. If you are looking for information on what policies Obama would support as a presidential candidate, you should look elsewhere. However, the book does give the impression that the writer is unusually forthright, both about himself and his beliefs.Watching Obama's attitudes on race evolve is one of the key points of interest in the book, and the reader comes away with a picture of a man who is both reflective and self-critical. It is somewhat apparent that the author was not running for office at the time the book was written, and yes, it (very briefly) mentions his now infamous flirtation with cocaine use. However, if you want to read a portrait of the man, if not his political platform, and interested in the struggles of someone growing up in between two different cultures, this book is well worth reading.
Some people may gripe over that their favorite character got only a small entry in the book but I was surprised at how complete this book was.Lets face it, unless DC reprints Who's Who you are not going to get a complete guide to the DC characters, this book is made to represent as many of their characters as they could. I enjoyed the entries about the lesser known characters and being given updates on some of the heros and villians I had followed but lost touch with.The DC Comics Encylopedia makes a nice gift for any comics fan.
Chuck Austen came into this story arc, claiming he would take the character "back to his roots," to the wisecracking, violent incarnation of Superman that dominated in the 30s and 40s. For some, this would be admirable, but when such a turn flies in the face of sixty years of character development, it looks more ridiculous than bold.Austen wrote two fill-in issues of Superman books before he started this regular gig. In both issues, a normal human character is introduced, bonds with Superman, and dies, causing Superman to begin brooding and questioning his role. In one of the issues, he goes after criminals with a fistful of wisecracks and a blatant disregard for human life, tossing inhabited cars into buildings and whatnot. That's not Superman, folks.Austen's Man of Steel reads like Spider-Man with a cape. He tells jokes, curses, constantly doubts his abilities, and acts in wholly uncharacteristic ways. Besides that, Austen's "plot" is plagued by too many attempts to look cool with no real substance. Gog and Doomsday attack over the course of the arc that begins with this TPB, and Superman gets repeatedly beaten, even by third-string villains like Weapons Master and no-string villains like the inexplicable Repo Man. The convoluted story makes no sense whatsoever, it does not have any sort of logical flow. Austen's writing fight scenes without cohesion or continuity.Oh, and just for fun, Austen decides to shake up Clark and Lois's marriage by divorcing Lana Lang and her husband, and portraying her as a desperate girl who can't get over her old high school crush, while simultaneously turning Lois Lane into a cold, jealous b*tch.The biggest shame of all of this is that Ivan Reis's fantastic art is wasted on such a terrible, terrible story.Austen can write, he proved that in the excellent maxi-series, "Superman: Metropolis." Unfortunately, his run on Action Comics lacked anything that made "Metropolis" good. Check your local comic shop for the 12 issues of that series (since I don't think they've ever been collected), and avoid this as if it were Kryptonite.
I really like this album, the only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is the sometimes overly cute mixing and sampling between the songs.A winner.
This is a great show and I'd recommend it but before purchasing on amazon check out TCL's website as it sells for 39.99. Even with the shipping charges it's cheaper.
I love a good joke. I wish I had the memory to be a good teller of jokes but I don't. Or I don't have the timing and delivery. There isn't anything really dirty about these jokes, most of them are older classics so no one should really be offended by them. If you are not easily offended by the language in any "R" rated movie, this is very easily digestible. I found myself laughing out loud several times reading through this. Some very funny stuff. You might be surprised that you have heard some of these jokes retold by friends or entertainers. Some are just antedotes. An enjoyable read. Let me give you several short examples: A man is really incomplete until he's married--then he's really finished. Trouble with being the Best Man at a wedding is you rarely get a chance to prove it. Women are the problem most men like to wrestle with. My favorite: The grade school principal dropped into the new 3rd grade teacher's room to see how she was adjusting to her first day of school. "There is one problem", she said "that little boy in the 1st row belongs in 2nd grade but insists on remaining here, and he's so smart I hate to send him back." "He can't be that smart" said the principal, "ask him something." The teacher called the boy forward and inquired, "What does a dog do on 3 legs that a man does on 2 legs and a lady does sitting down?" "Shakes hands" said the boy. "What has a cow got 4 of that I only have 2 of" she went on. "Legs" the boy replied. "What is a 4 letter word meaning intercourse?" she continued. "Talk" he answered. The teacher turned to the principal, "Well what should I do?"He drew her aside and whispered, "Better promote him to the 4th grade, I missed all 3 questions."
I've been using the Diamon Deb nail files for years when I could find them and I loved them. The quality now is not near what it used to be when they were made in the USA. :(
I've just finished the Farseer trilogy and decided to weigh in on the first book so everyone knows what they're getting into. This book was pure genius. The author goes through great pains to describe all of her characters, and does it by never shifting viewpoints from the main character! That means that you get first person perspective from the most important character in the series for all 3 books. There were some times when the character development dragged and seemed a bit excessive but in the end the vivid pictures she painted for them was well worth it. I found myself growing very attached to FitzChivalry and hoping he would eventually succeed. I've never seen such a "normal" hero in all of my time reading fantasy. Fitz isn't a large or strong man. He doesn't have the ability to shoot fireballs from his hands or light from his eyes. He cannot foretell the future. His unique ability is the special relationship with his wolf (known as the Wit) and his ability with the Skill. The full potential and capability of what one can do with the Skill is still a mystery to me. It was seldom used by Fitz in direct defense of his life and never fully mastered throughout the series. FitzChivalry was definetly the most unique protagonist I've ever read and this epic trilogy ranks in my top 3 favorite of all time.Hobb's strengths lie in her ability to make you empathize with her characters. I grew so deeply attached to them all and felt a strong longing for more after I sat the last book down. Fortunately the Tawney Man series is filling that void for me (the next trilogy involving the same characters - at least the ones that make it out alive). I warn you, this series will consume you once you pick it up. It will leave you yearning for even more information but it will not disappoint. It smacks of early George Martin (without the senseless destruction of all the characters you love) and makes Robert Jordan's work seem almost tepid. The only problem I had with this series is the actual binding of the book. I'd recommend finding a hard cover set, or even a kindle version of the trilogy because the cheap paperback reprints are bound so poorly that you nearly have to bend half the book all the way back to read some of the words in the fold (the words are not properly centered on the page and are so left justified that you have to put a lot of pressure on the spine to read first or last word of every sentence).
Overall 4 stars, this movie had much potential to be a classic but sluggish parts and some toned down important scenes eventually keep it from being a great. One of the actors looks just like Axel Rose and he acts like him too... David Hess is good and this film certainly has its moments, one of the better Italian horrors Ive seen
I recently moved to a new apartment and noticed various insects coming into the apartment from the window (yuck! Even those with many legs which look very hairy). Upon inspecting the window, I noticed gaps between the net and the base of the window. After shaking extensively the bottle for one minute, I applied it on the gaps. It is easily removable at first (before it dries and hardens).You have to be VERY gentle with the release trigger as it is very sensitive. It is also very important to have a screwdriver (or something very thin and long) so that you can clean the plastic "straw" so that the material won't dry inside.
Ok I suppose I am a bit biased because Zachary Smith is my father. I hope you all know he played lead guitar on this CD. I mean I grew up with this band. I was in the recording studo when probably some of this CD and &quot;the tape of only linda&quot; were recorded. I love this music. It has very interesting lyrics to analyze. Also Scott has an amazing voice. He has such a unique sound. Buy this album whoever hasn't.
Pins do not come in a box, they come in a baggie.Quality of pins are okay though.I would order again.
After watching the first 30 minutes of this film, I thought it was going to be a simple, elegant story of self-discovery and unrequited love. In many ways it was this, but it delivers a rather unexpected surprise in the process. It could be argued that the movie gets thrown off track a bit after these surprising events unfold, but that's exactly how it is in life, so I didn't mind. If you enjoy story lines that are obvious and include numerous explosions and gun battles, this is definitely not the movie for you. If, however, you like more subtle explorations of human psychology, then I recommend this film.
This book promised to be entertaining and was, somewhat. However, I found it depressing that she had to grope for platitudes and sentimental stories to find a meaning for life and death. IMHO, she missed out on the comfort of faith in Christ who lived a perfect life in our place, and died to give us heaven without us having to earn it by being &#34;good&#34; people. It ended up in my recycling bin.
I haven't been able to find this tea in awhile and am so glad I checked here on Amazon! This tea is soothing when served hot, and refreshing when steeped and poured over a cup of ice to make iced tea. I love it!
I had never heard of Charles Cochran before. But Bill Mays is someone who makes everything he touches quite special, if he is on a CD, I am all ears.The choice of music is stunning. The version of Johnny Mercer and Jimmy Van Heusen's, "I Thought About You" gets every milligram of emotion out one of the greatest songs ever written. The lyric was written as a tribute to Judy Garland.The last cut is also quite special, "Do you Miss New York". A beautiful lyric and it becomes a duet the last 30 seconds. Mays and Cochran make an endearing harmony and it ends the CD with a wonderfully wistful note. Bravo!!!!
okay, not entirely awful. Just really generic. I see a lot people here really like (or have liked) these guysat one point...and also seem to like Sum 41, Blink 182, Simple Plan, etc...all generic. You carelessly throw around the term hardcore, pop-punk, punk...none of this falls into those category.Look into bands like Screeching Weasel, the Queers, Anti-Flag, NOFX, Pinhead Gunpowder, Mr T Experience, White Flag, Operation Ivy (who later became Rancid, who later became, partially, the transplants) Catch 22, Snapcase, Bracket, Against All Authority, Hatebreed, and early Green day...when they were on Lookout! Records. (everything after that is just a rehashing of the same 3 chord progression with...and not in a traditional punk rock way)early Less Than Jake, Suicide Machines and more recently, the Blackouts (now Living in Blue)That, my friends, is good punk / pop-punk / hardcore.
Here's my advice: review the book's contents (you'll need to visit O'Reilly's site at http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/httptdg/). Do you need a complete understanding of the topics? If so, buy this book. Everything is clearly explained in detail, with the chapters on security and internationalization being especially good. Highly recommended!
The "Chicago Swing Fan" who complained below may do well to remember that Glenn Miller's never really was a swing band. Miller was foremost a businessman, and his orchestra played commercial dance music. Good dance music? Good big band music? Yes, I think so, but in terms of swing, he didn't hold a candle to Benny Goodman in his prime. Having said that, don't expect hot, jazzy swing from this CD. If you like the old Miller records, you'll love this CD. It was recorded sometime around 1990 by the current band going under the Miller name, and all in all, represents a tasty selection of holiday goodies in authentic Miller style. Occasionally, some of the arrangements sound bit more "modern" than anything Miller would have played in his lifetime, but the general feeling is there. The disc is well-recorded and has great sound. It's quite pleasant and makes a great accompaniment for decorating the tree, Christmas parties, driving around town, sipping egg nog--just about anything! When my original copy of this broke several years ago (yes, it shattered... don't ask how!) I quickly ordered another copy. This CD has become one of my favorite holiday recordings. And for the price, you can't go wrong. Recommended.
I bought this sander about 6 months ago and have used it on several projects ranging from composite board bookshelves, to an aluminum hot tub, to an Oak enclosure for the hot tub. It has really done well on everything. I would likely use a harder pad on Aluminum if I were doing a lot of it but the OEM pad was perfect for the hardboard and Oak. The sander cuts well and is balanced well enough to produce a nice flat surface or finesse a perfectly rounded edge.The 6" paper is harder to find than the more common 5" and you don't usually see the same kind of selection or volume discounts on it locally - although Grizzly does sell both in bulk. Hook and eye paper is a bit more expensive than sticky paper but it wears so much better, and I really like being able to use a disk half way and pull it off to use a different grit, then reuse it later.This is definitely not a detail sander and doesn't cut like a belt sander but it was a good tradeoff for me. The front handle is removable but really doesn't stick out enough to be a problem. I had a minor problem with the detachable handle getting loose but simply removing it completely and re-installing it fixed that. The threads may have been dirty. I tried a few similar sanders before buying this one. It isn't the brute that the Milwaukee is and it isn't as petite as the Hitachi. I needed something in the middle and opted for this one and it works. My shop has open sides so dust collection isn't usually an issue but a major failing on many sanders like this is the dust collection and I have to comment that the dust collection on this thing actually works very well and doesn't get in the way. It is a good tool.
I hate bad staplers and I really hate bad staple removers. I had a staple remover once that was awesome, but it finally wore out because most of it was made of plastic with just the metal tip to remove the staples.So I bought some other staple removers and they were terrible. Either the metal tip was too thick, or it wasn't shaped properly and would rip the paper when removing staples.I saw this one and tried it and I love it! It got a workout the other day when I had to go through a file so I could scan it. There so many staples to be removed! The thing worked like a charm!!Now I have some at the office and have one for home! Staples beware!!The only think I would change about this device would be to have a rubber or plastic thicker handle on it. But other than that, this staple remover is perfection, and it looks as if it will last forever!
Buy this movie because you will want to watch it again. I got few very funny movies and this one is one of them...I don't regret getting it. I also bought Tropic Thunder DVD, Paul DVD, Rat Race DVD and more, you can check my reviews for ideas. Have fun!
I've played the series since FFOne for the SNES. They were good. All of them were good until I played FFT for the PSOne. The game was hard. I'm a regular game player. Not avid, but a regular joe. The learning curve was unbelievable. There was so much to learn. I felt asleep just trying to complete the tutorial. I didn't like it as much.Now that this version came out. It's more simplified for average guys like me. I'm still playing it. It's a good games for the average game player. Loyal Final Fantasy Tactics fanatics might be disappointed, but I like it.
Bought one of these from Pep Boys and had it for years till it broke. Couldn't find anymore until I finally found them here at Amazon. Best ever squeegee. Works great on glass. Also works great to squeegee off the whole car after you've washed it. Hardly any need to towel dry it after that.
In "Alexander Hamilton," Chernow has written a masterful biography. Long overlooked as one of the most influential figures in the developmental stage of the Republic, Ron Cherhow tackled the task of sketching Alexander Hamilton's life superbly. Unlike many of the other founders, namely Franklin, Washington, Jefferson, or Adams, relatively little has been writing about Hamilton. Frankly speaking, however, Hamilton played as great a role in the development of this country when compared to some of the names listed above.Chernow expends much energy elucidating Hamilton's very close relationship with General Washington which started during the Revolutionary War and extended up until Washington's death shortly after his presidency ended. During his presidency and after, Washington both confided in Hamilton and took counsel from him, thus solidifying Hamilton's position as the foremost advisor in Washington's cabinet. This fact alone elevates Hamilton to almost preeminent status.Furthermore, Chernow describes the politics of the period, specifically how Hamilton's promotion of a national banking system and other Treasury functions led to the formation of the party system. Most notably, a continuing theme throughout the book deals specifically with Hamilton's role as founder of the federalist party and how he constantly feuded politically and personally with Jefferson, Madison, and Monrow as founders of the Republican party of the time.With regard to this topic and Hamilton's politics in general, Chernow has defended Hamilton much to vociferously. Instead of telling the story of Hamilton's life, Chernow has taken on the ardor of an apologist. For eaxample, during his life, Hamilton was repeatedly painted (either appropriately or inappropriately) as a monarchist by his political enemies. Chernow has spent a considerable amount of space attempting to debunk this notion. However, in the final pages of the book Chernow himself admits that Gouverneur Morris, Hamilton's eulogist, worried aloud in his own diary that Hamilton "was on principle opposed to republican and attached to monarchical government." This is not to say that Hamilton did in fact harbor outright anti-republican and anti-constitutional feelings. In fact, to the contrary, Hamilton's greatest fear on behalf of the new nation was a secessionist movement perpetrated by Republicans in the South or other politcally malevolent factions. That said, however, from time to time Hamilton did express skepticism and other less-than-confident feelings with regard to the newly ratified Constitution. Though he worked tirelessly with Madison and John Jay in publishing the Federalist essays in the New York papers, Hamilton did not share Madison's nor Jefferson's absolute intrepidity with regard to the document.Finally, the epilogue of Chernow's book specifically covers Eliza Hamilton and her life post-Hamilton's death. It seems entirely appropriate that the summation of a book about Alexander Hamilton is dedicated to his wife. Here was a woman who ardently supported her husband even after he had been forced to sheepishly broadcast to the world his marital indiscretions with Maria Reynolds. Furthermore, one cannot help but think compassionately of Eliza and her seven children as Chernow describes that fateful morning at Weehawken, New Jersey on the banks of the Hudson River. Chernow's chapter on "The Duel" was supremely written and as captivating as any climax to any novel ever written. Yet as I sat reading it, I could not help but think of Eliza and how oblivious she must have been to her husband's impending death.Chernow's "Alexander Hamilton" is an incredible book even if it is interjected with somewhat less of an even-handed approach to the protagonist's life. It is highly readable and flows wonderfully.
The author said that with a few translations of keystrokes one could use Mac and this book. Not so easy...This is frustrating, because I'm not sure what other book might actually teach the Mac version of version 3. There are a lot of very specific techniques in this book, and it's not a bad reference, but it certainly left this Mac user very frustrated and looking for another source.
Didn't even take this map on my trip. Not as useful as the map included with purchase inside Frommer's Toronto 2011. Since laminated, might be useful if caught in the rain without an umbrella.
This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made.I feel like i was ripped off even though i only paid a dollar to rent it.Please rent it first before you even think of buying it.I have not reviewed anything on amazon in a long time.But this movie was so bad i felt like i had to write a review.
This new Keith Urban CD is just great, even better than all the others, if that's possible. His tracks are full of emotion, sensitivity, good beats, great lyrics and Keith Urban's singing is as gorgeous as ever. I highly recommend this CD to any Keith Urban or country music fan.
The FACT is that Dr Francis A. Schaeffer continues to be one of the GREATEST MINDS of the 20th century. Period.Those who admit this and then try to pretend to disagree with some of his works &quot;I found faults&quot; or &quot;it wasn't quite writen well enough&quot; win only hoots of laughter.They haven't got the intellectual capacity to tie his shoes and their attempts to play Judge on Schaeffer is as funny as the &quot;Judges&quot; of Jesus or Socrates!!BUY the books and learn from them.You'll NEVER get a better work outside of the Holy Bible.
This is a great book but needs to be digested slowly. Han Urs Von Balthasar is a fantastic theologian but not a "light read" by any stretch of the imagination. Take your time and you will reap tremendous rewards.
If you want something difirent from the usual hardcore &amp; metalcore sound in the likes esocharis,incubus, and,candiria get burnt by the sun's &quot;soundtrack to the personal revolution&quot; im shure you will enjoy this album like i did! Basically all the songs are great specialy &quot;dracula with glasses&quot; my fav track here...Buy it now!
come together to make the best jazz cd of 2005 and I rate it only 4*'s. That's how mediocre jazz releases have become in the past year. Sly and Fall Forward are actually outstanding tracks (go download them on i-tunes for 99 cents each-burn them on cd then rip them to .mp3 files-voila! they're yours). Other top Jazz CD's for 2005 are of course Flipside by Jeff Lorber, Soel's-Memento (don't sleep on this) andd King Britt's Chicago (not NY) Chill Suite-"On the Seventh" which is actually elevator music for the Hyatt Hotel chain. Also, keep an eye out for something called Black Gold Massive in MAY-they have loose ties to "Down to the Bone". Let's hope the state of jazz improves in the coming months-peace....
I'd say from reviews of this story that Silver Nemesis is one of those Dr Who tales you either love or hate. For the record, the story involves a living metal which was sent into orbit by the Doctor, but which crashes to Earth in the late twentieth century. Its arrival heralds the appearance of the Fourth Reich, the time-travelling medieval Lady Peinforte, and the Cybermen. Okay, so this episode has some pretty silly concepts (anything orbitting the Earth with a decaying orbit would not take 25 years to go round, the Cybermen are too weedy for words - military weapons fail to penetrate their armour, yet a gold-headed arrow can do so easily (gold being a soft metal) and the way the Doctor escapes the guards in the castle just defies camp comedy). But why can't people just enjoy this for what it is - three episodes of entertaining, sci-fi escapism. The action is fast-paced, the story is filled with interesting characters, there are plenty of humorous touches and the music is great. This video also contains the making of Silver Nemesis, which is a bonus.
After having read a good number of books in the &quot;Franken vs. O'Reilly&quot; genre, I found Brock's book engrossing not just because of the politics involved, but because the story seemed so deeply personal and honest. I couldn't put it down.
Got through about 150 pages, but the story was just a bit too far fetched for my tastes. The reading went easy enough, but the "Star Chamber" theme has been overdone and seemed almost silly. Couldn't finish the book.
I think you could probably make the correct assumption 99% of the time that if you hear someone make the claim that Freemasonry is somehow tied to the Knights Templar, that claim is being made by a Freemason.Maybe's, possibly's, it is likely, not inconceivable, not beyond the realm of thought..... Everything is true when you can condition it. It's a pity no one who writes books on freemasonry/templars bothers to either read, or at least reference in any detail, Malcom Barber or Stephen Runciman, the most learned templar/crusad scholars of the 19th and 20th century. In fact, Mr. Barber, whose knowledge of the Templars far suprasses Knight, Lomas, Pickett, et al, has acknowledged that there is a nice little cottage industry of Templarism--which is a product of the innuendo, speculation and supposition.Does anybody who writes about this Templar/Freemason connection bother to point out that just about 99 % of the Templars couldn't read or write? That Jaque de Molay, the last grand master, couldn't read or write and required assistance with any document that was presented to him during his inquisition and trial? What do you think these illiterate folks found and then tried to keep secret for all these years? I'm sure the sheep who follow this stuff will probably find this review not helpful, but do yourself a favor, open your eyes and put out the consiparcy garbage and read Malcom Barber's The Trial of the Templars; The New Knighthood : A History of the Order of the Temple and Stephen Runciman's History of the Crusades (It is pricy and 3 volumes, but it is acknowledged as the finest piece of work detailing the crusades). If you want to at least be honest with yourself and not cast your lot with revisionist history, read Barber
Vangelis created the mood and sound of Blade Runner. This CD captures that perfectly (except for the rather out of style &quot;one more kiss dear&quot;- what was that there for?)
The cover of this album is strikingly similar to the cover of the Flower Kings' "The Rainmaker." And the male vocalist in track #4 sounds just like Roine Stolt. The churning heavy guitars bring to mind The 3rd And The Mortal while the swirling keyboards and melodic interludes mimic the Flower Kings. Does this give a clue as to the major influences here? Indeed, this is excellent heavy Prog rock which sounds like a cross between the Flower Kings and The 3rd And The Mortal. This is by far the heaviest White Willow album to date and whether you prefer it over Willow's previous efforts is simply a matter of taste. In my opinion, this is a vast improvement over the overrated previous album "Sacrament" which I found to be too slow and plodding and too lacking in variety to maintain my interest. Being a headbanger at heart, I like the new heavier direction. This album is full of all the elements I like about Progressive Rock: great singing, interesting, non-cliched thought-provoking lyrics, lots of variety, oodles of mellotron, great melodies, sweeping, grand, bombastic arrangements, a dark melancholy feel, and of course those wonderful heavy guitars. It ranks right up there with "Ex Tenebris" as my favorite White Willow album.
I decided to read this book out of curiosity's sake. I wish I hadn't bothered. I don't think Colbert really understands what FM or CFS really are, nor does he really understand the best way to treat these illnesses. While diet changes certainly help many, it is not the be-all and end-all in treating these illnesses.
First of all, I really loved my perculator in the beginning and still would, except it has developed rust only in the heating ring element in the bottom of the coffee maker. It's not coffee stains it's rust. Otherwise it heats it perfectly and makes great coffee no matter the brand.Since I don't know what the long term effects of using it with rust, I opt for a different brand.
This was my first book on filmmaking howto, and i don,t regret it. This is a general introduction to film making, covering both traditional 16-35 mm mediums and video. It's out of date if you're looking for references to all the latests video hd tech, but a nevertheless very worthwhile.
Say what you want but Donna Richardson is a great motivator, great instructor and the exercises work! This four day rotation isall a person needs when they are looking to supplement their fitness routine or are looking for a quick workout on those busy (or lazy) days.There are four sections(abs, buns, arms and thighs) each section has its own warm-up and cool down and traditional exercise routines that will effectively tone each body part.Donna is full of energy always encouraging anmd motivating you and she has such a down to earth feel that the exercises are not even a chore.This is an excellent video to add to your library and is worth every penny.
This game had a lot of hype before it was released and it lives up to it.Both single player and multiplayer are awesome. The sound is incredible and the graphics are the best that will put out by the XBOX.The best part of this game for me is to play CO-OP Campaign on Legendary with a buddy. Nirvana.
The Complete Bike Book falls short of the book's title. The book is lavishly illustrated with color photos on virtually every page. As an informal treatment on the subject of bicycling, it does an average job. While the book tries to cover everything from road biking to mountain biking, the information is scarce and only provides thumbnail glimpses of each topic that is covered. Most of the photographs seem rather dark and underexposed. This may be a result of the publisher not keeping an eye out on quality control. This book is rather expensive and thin. For the price of this book, you would probably do better to purchase &quot;Richard's 21st Century Bike Book&quot; which does a much better job of covering bicycling.
First of all, I wasn't expecting very much from this movie. I just thought it would be mildly entertaining, like Troy, or Charlie's Angels, or any one of the James Bond movies. Not life changing, but entertaining. Indeed, all I was looking for was a shallow action movie. Now, I have no idea how they managed to do it with a perfectly good action movie topic like Alexander the Great, but it was incredibley boring.First of all, the dialogue is awful. And when I say awful, I mean AWFUL. Why is it awful, that's kind of hard to describe. People just randomly arguing with eachother every second for no reason in particular except to add to the drama. As well as this, everything sounds incredibly awkward. no matter what the context. It's strange that in any James Bond film, M can say to Bond that he needs to kill so and so or else the White House will get nuked and make it sound just fine when Alexander can't say "I wanna conquer India" without sounding like a socially awkward teenager. The acting sucks too, but even an Oscar winning actor would sound awful with this script.Second of all, the plot is unbearably slow. Battle scenes seldom occur, and basically nothing happens. He gets married, there are flashbacks that show when his dad was killed, he argues with his troops, nothing all that exciting. Normally I wouldn't mind bad dialogue and acting in this sort of a film if there were good battles, but there aren't any. As opposed to dramatically conquering India or any other place, it just has the narrator say so instead of it actually being shown.If you want a fun action movie, don't waste your time on this, there are plenty of other options.
This is a great backpack for college!It has pockets for everything and my 17in. laptop fit in the laptop part perfectly. I used it all 5 years in college, and it's still in great shape. So I definitely recommend it for college student or anyone who has to carry things around a lot like college students.
When I first heard about "2012" prior to it's release, I thought "Ooh geez, here comes another doomsday piece of quackery." When I saw the previews, and learned that Roland Emmerich was the director, well, it all made sense. Of course the visual effects in the trailers were awesome, but I didn't feel like buying into the 2012, end of the world story line. I'd thought Emmerich had been a tad heavy handed with "Day After Tomorrow" and so I avoided "2012" at the box office and waited for "Avatar."After seeing "2012" on Blu-Ray, I admit I was wrong. If you just suspend disbelief a little bit, sit back, and allow yourself to be entertained, this film will not disappoint. No mistaking here, willful suspension of disbelief is necessary. There are just too many close calls, near misses, and coincidences to take the film on anything but a surface level. But, if you allow yourself to be drawn in to the eye popping special effects, the incredible depth of detail in the CGI rendering of destruction, the wry sense of humor, you can actually have a pretty good time with this movie. My son said he can't wait for this film to be turned into some kind of ride at Universal Orlando.It IS a long movie, and the characters are paper thin, with a plot that hangs on a thread of scientific information. But, it doesn't FEEL long, you become invested in the characters, and the science begins not to matter. In fact, the film's pace moves along quite nicely. And though the characters are thin, you do "root" for John Cusack to succeed in saving his estranged wife, resentful son, and precocious daughter. Heck, halfway through you even begin rooting for the wife's boyfriend to survive! How the film resolves itself is actually a bit of a surprise (if it hasn't been spoiled for you elsewhere). I actually think that the marketing of the film did a disservice. If more of the character driven moments had been shown in the previews, I probably would have bit on seeing the movie in a theater.And so, there is an entertaining plot with interesting characters, lot of really excellent visual effects, and a satisfying ending. It even survives multiple screenings. The Blu-Ray 2 disc special edition includes a few deleted scenes, an alternate ending (too much suspension of disbelief required), and a variety of behind the scenes featurettes. I think it's a good value.I do have to mention that the U.S.S. John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier was retired from active duty several years ago, and therefore would not be at sea, in a position to tumble into the White House as a tsunami wipes out Washington in 2012. Having said that, I must humorously add that Danny Glover's President Thomas Wilson had the entirely wrong line as he looked up to see the ship coming. He should have said, "I'm too old for this s#$t!" (Not knocking Danny Glover's performance - just thinking that the call back to "Lethal Weapon" was dying to be used)
Our hamster didn't like this nearly as much as he does the ball, it does look cool, but for actual use, I would just go with the ball!
I had some problem getting the pieces to snap together properly. It still works but the separate pieces don't make a perfect seel with each other. Other than that... its a broom, what do ya expect?
I always had problems rubbing in the shampoo and rinsing it all off with a large cup, dog squirming around the bathtub trying to get away from me. Well not anymore! It really could not be any easier... pull the trigger to get wet, push the button for shampoo, and then rinse....my dog even, dare I say - enjoys it, and lays there like he is getting a spa treatment! Now if only drying him was this easy! Highly recommend!*(I don't know why the title says hose not included, but mine came with one)
Continuing in the direction set by &quot;John Henry&quot;, TMBG has never sounded more like a full band than in this album. While &quot;Factory Showroom&quot; sounded a little half-hearted, &quot;Mink Car&quot; is full-blown TMBG. You will grin, laugh, and generally bop to the sounds in this album.Everything in this album has a polish that is worthy of a top studio effort, from the numerous guest musicians to the detailed liner graphics, even as the songs peck at genres as diverse as hip-hop and disco. Without the hilarious lyrics, for example, a casual listener might mistake &quot;Man, It's So Loud In Here&quot; for a Pet Shop Boys B-side. Production values have never been so high for this band of &quot;John's&quot; and &quot;Dan's&quot;. The credits even dutifully thank the microphones that were used for the recording sessions, microphones that they surely could not have afforded earlier in their career. This obviously high-budget approach is especially apparent next to the raw sound of &quot;Lincoln&quot; which now sounds like it was funded by several weeks of mac-and-cheese dinners and mixed in their basement.Mind you, I love the unpolished sound of the early TMBG albums, but I have no doubt that this charm was serendipity at its best and could never be replicated again with John and John's new-found popularity and growth as song writers. &quot;Factory Showroom&quot; was puberty. Welcome to TMBG's adulthood. Don't worry, they have not lost their sense of humor.Listening to this album feels like reuniting with your fun-loving 25 year old cousin whom you last saw when he was 10.
and Olympia Dukakis. But this is one of my favorite movies. It is very moving to see her come into her own and I could totally relate. It is romantic, emotional, heart-wrenching, heart-warming and very funny in places.
Laahoven and Aarts, particulary Aarts, made a great stuff in heuristic reference book. Even though Simulated Annealing (SA) has long history but there is no work as complete as this book. Don't let the publication date fools you, 10 year book stills as good as yesterday for its comprehensive and the story of SA. Even though Aarts edits several books and papers after this book, they are far different from this solid SA book. I don't have this book though, just read it from Library loan. It's a sad story for this book is out of print. I wish the publisher will have it for you soon.
I didn't find the story interesting at all. I read this book because the story outline looked appealing and because of the warm review. I was disappointed. The story has not much substance and it is loosely-knitted.
This item arrived with very good instructions and the appropriate hardware. It was easy to assemble and works better than I expected. I am thoroughly satisfied with this product. As a side note, the instruction sheet included warranty information and a phone number to contact customer service in case there were any missing parts. This product came in an Everlast box and was promptly shipped. I don't understand why people who buy products outside of Amazon can criticize those products here - this is to review not only the product, but the product supplied by Amazon - the Amazon "experience." Don't be misled, this is a good product that has all the necessary consumer support to ensure a positive experience.
* Here are the good things about this book+ You get 15% discount when u buy the voucher.+ Lot of pictures, so beginners won't be scared reading it.+ Lot of EASY exam questions in the text book.+ Text font is huge...I like it.* Here are the bad things about the book+ The material is written only 50% toward the MCDST 20-271 exam. What this means is that you will gain a better understanding on how to use Windows XP after reading this book, BUT NOT TO PASS THE TEST.+ This book is more written to answer the question HOW, but NOT "WHAT IF."+ 50% or more questions on the practice exam are extremely confusing. This includes wordiness, unnecessary text, extremely long sentences and irrelevant subjects, objects, including the user in question, what is he doing, what does he want.+ Most questions are 2-3 paragraphs with 5-6 sentences in each. Yet, the paragraph is so confusing and pointless that you will not even understand the question, not even talking about how to answer it.+ More than 60% of the answers on the practice exam actually come from real hand on experience and not from the book. You will not find the answers for the practice exam from the book.+ The practice exam on the CD have VERY small font size. I have to increase my display setting DPI to 200% just so I can read it. This is ridiculous.+ The practice exam on the CD is buggy, I can't even print the questions and results of the test, even the option to print is available.**** The conclusion+ Buy the book anyway, you get 15% discount price on the test+ The book has more than 311 practice questions. Answering them will help you understand the material more. Of course, this means you must read another beneficial book before reading this book.+ ... And that's pretty much it.
This book, like most written and portraying Hurricane Katrina, leads the reader to the conclusion that New Orleans is the only area devastated thereby. For anyone's information, New Orleans was on the West, or weak, side of Katrina. New Orleans was flooded because: 1) elevation there is about 7 feet BELOW sea level and 2)their levy system has NEVER been built to withstand cat 3 or greater storms. EVERY drop of rain that falls in New Orleans has to be pumped out, one way or the other. If the citizens of New Orleans had put more money into improving their levy system instead of the SuperDome, they might very well be living in dry and undamaged homes today instead of morning their dead and trying to put their city back together. New Orleans will be rebuilt someday and I hope and pray that they have learned and benefited from this disaster and won't make the same mistakes again. If you want to read and look at a balanced book coverning Hurricane Katrina, this isn't it.
This is just another one of those dumb, boring, and lazy memorization courses that doesn't have a clue about teaching a language.The first lesson is basics, which only teaches things like, I, you, her, him, and we. Not much else. From there they figure you are now fluent in French so lesson 2 goes into transportation words and phrases. The next 14 lessons do the same thing, picking a topic and just rattling off a bunch of phrases, once in English then twice in French, before going to the next phrase.In some of the later lessons of Level 2 they do go into some more basic things but these should have been covered way at the beginning. You will be so frustrated within the first few lessons of Level 1 that you will never make it this far. If you do, there is no reason for them to go into these basics as their method is simply to memorize phrases.Another bad thing they do is use wrong translations. In some of the lessons they want you to say "Excuse me" which in French is "Excusez-moi". However, they keep translating it in French to "s'il vous plat" which means "please". Two totally different words. It is hard to do a course when you have to keep wondering what words they are teaching you are wrong and which are correct.I have to agree with the other reviewers who said this is nothing but someone reading out of a dictionary with no teaching, memory aids, pronunciation help, conversation, or grammar.The only thing this course will do is make you hate learning a language.If you want a good basic introduction into French, try "French in No Time".
Very attractive motion detector light for the front door. Easily installed and has worked with no problems. Make sure you have some weathproof caulk to seal around the base of the light, to keep rain and bugs from the inside of the base.
Michael Gira should be bigger than most of his contemporaries. In fact, he should have hit it big with Swans years ago for creating a truly original, unrelenting sound. However, it is an indisputable fact that the mainstream prefers a watered down, easily accessible sound as opposed to music that is actually challenging. Gira's one and only major label release, The Burning World, proved to be a commercial failure. In many ways, The Angels of Light continue down the path that The Burning World opened up. And while Swans explored the depths of different textures of sound, The Angels of Light strips everything down to the most basic and intimate levels. With that said, Gira has become a fine singer/songwriter.
The title of this review refers to all the ways a fire can be described in a few pages of a book...however, as cheesy as it seems, this was actually a really good book. I liked the author's style. Of course, sometimes the geography section of any true crime book can be a little slow. You can always feel free to skim those parts and get to the nitty gritty of the crimes. I think the prosecution did not prove their case and I guess I have to read the other account written on this Olivia Riner arson mystery. I don't feel the author was too slanted towards one side or the other. I think she was innocent too. You should never assume a foreigner can understand their Miranda rights without help from a translator or an attorney of their own. This is like the Amanda Knox case in that she was subjected to a foreign jury system without much help in the beginning. Both women were trying to be helpful to the other country's police and got in way over their heads.
This is a very complete operating system with a large library of free software. I had no trouble installing it (setup detected all my hardware on an IBM Thinkpad A20m), but was very frustrated at first with the interface. The documentation is difficult to read, and this is not for beginners.After a few days of using Linux, I've found that I can do everything I need to do with it, and even run my windows programs on it. However, it took the better part of a day for me to understand how to configure things. The GUI they start you off with is terrible but by changing a few settings it becomes very functional and friendly.
This is one of the rare books that I could not even finish. Very inaccurate and it seems as if it was one more outlet for Mr. Pacheco to toot his own horn some more. I do not want to go into all of the mistakes but please do not read this and think that you have learned anything.
I got one at a major bath & home store, went back the next day for several more. Four brown dress pants on one hanger. Four black/grey dress pants on one hanger. You save space, and the visual organization is really helpful. Also the shirt hangers that let you put several hangers downward in sequence (same brand different item) - the type with independent hangers you "hook" together are less awkward than the type with five blouse hangers built solid into one rack.
Everyone loved the dip, which is from the recipe on the package. Will order again.
Diana Wynne Jones is a writer who deserves to be better known and more widely read in the USA, and this is surely her most complicated, subtle book. It is not a young child's book nor a read-aloud one; and it is not for the person looking for a straight-ahead story of sorcery and adventure. It is the sort of book that needs a reader who is willing to do some of the work: for example by not just rushing by the quotes at the head of each chapter but reading them and thinking how they might relate to the plot; noticing how the book is structured and taking that as a hint; and so on. Read the other reviews and see how much those who did loved the book -- even though they were still confused by the ending.In my opinion, Jones has asked too much of her readers. There is work that the reader just can't do (or I couldn't) to fill in the gaps. This would be a better (but longer) book if she had filled in some of the gaps; made some of the emotional transitions more understandable; given explanations for some of the weird things that are never explained. (Like: is the picture really changed, or is it Polly's perceptions that are changed?)And there's no word for the ending but "confusing" and that's hard to forgive in a writer as good and as experienced as Jones. It reads to me as if she had a deadline and just finished the dang chapter somehow to get it out. The imagery is baffling; the rules of the contest are baffling; the final result is baffling (is Laurel still alive? Can Polly and Tom now be friends or not? is Leslie free now? &c.;) and there is no emotional payoff, no resolution of the emotional tension between Polly and the other characters.Despite this, I give it 4 stars because of all the really good things in it. Polly is a gallant and clever person to live with. There's lots of subtle humor (like Polly at age 11 setting out to make herself a hero). The whole issue of how Polly deals with her flawed and unreliable parents is told with immense sympathy and power. And so on. Just don't expect to understand the ending...
5 stars isn't enough for this album. This and Insomniac more the first Green Day albums i bought, but nothing is as good as nimrod. A lot of other Green Day albums have good material, but no other album has ever given me the feeling that Nimrod gives you. This is the only album i ever bought where it takes a whole-year of listening to the album for the songs to get old.
First of all the prints are lousy for book 1 looks like 16mm prints to dvd.Too bad this great series has been edited with lousy digital transfer.episodes 5 and six look faded in color and sound is muffed. Why are these episodes edited?, the Robert Reed nude scene as brief as it was was cut out of this release I have a region 2 copy to prove it. In the scene where he is seducing Susan Blakely and Nick Nolte and his buddy are watching Reed Through the windows pouring a drink naked.The scene where he passes a table and goes up stairs is fully cut from this version you could see part of his willie and pubes as well a part of his butt going up the stairs, why would they cut this tiny little segment out, makes no sense but now am i getting a censored version of the mini series. very pissed off I am glad I have region 2's version.It a shame we have too put up with bad prints when you know a negative exists that they can remaster.
I just went and saw this with my ten year old boy. I wasn't a fan of the TV serial since I don't go in for marionettes but this film was very good.The basic story is about the youngest son who wants to join in on the family business of rescuing people. He and his two closest friends get their chance when the Father and 4 older brothers are attacked by a super villain known as 'The Hood' (Ben Kingsley) and need rescuing themselves.I liked this movie. It had a few lessons to teach about earning your way (no shortcuts) and being loyal. The only parts that disappointed me were a couple of "man-bashing" references during the film that seemed petty and inappropriate. Is anybody else fed up with that kind of stuff?Overall though, I give this a big thumbs up as a family film that had excitement, adventure and even some good laughs. Take your kids, I think you'll all like it.Recommended.
At last a first rate anthology of the recordings the Small Faces made on Immediate Records .Fifty glorious , uncompromising pop songs recorded between 1967 - 1969 , influenced by R&B; , soul , folk , psychedelia , music hall , and seasoned with a bit of English eccentricity was certainly a magic formula , but add to that the great white soul voice of Steve Marriot , and you had a band in a league of their own . Songs such as Tin Soldier , Lazy Sunday , and Itchycoo Park are classics of course , but after a few plays of this double cd you`ll soon realise that there are many more hidden gems and classics waiting to be discovered .The remastering is excellent , - it`s almost like hearing these tracks for the first time again , and the foldout booklet that comes with this release only reinforces the fact that this is the definitive anthology of their Immediate recordings ( by a country mile ) .A release that for once does justice to this great band . Sadly , this hasn`t always been the case .
This was a purchase I thought about for a long time, not sure if I would use it to full advantage. I'm still not sure I will, but it's a beautiful new toy/working tool, and now that I've had it for a month, I wouldn't want to be without it.I'm a digital artist, and I already had an Intuos3 tablet for a couple of years, which I adore. It sits on the keyboard ledge beside my led lit gamers' keyboard (I don't play games; I just like that it's lit and doesn't have the number keypad). I needed to replace my old CRT monitor, and after much looking decided to go for this Cintiq.I've only got one issue at this point: When the Intuos3 is directly in line with the Cintiq, the mouse jitters badly. Move the Intuos a foot to either side, and there's no problem. On the night when the Cintiq arrived, I called tech support (who BTW, was very patient, knowledgeable, friendly, and spoke perfect American English) to help me with the setup, and he said once I got my workspace configured the way I wanted it, I could call back, and they'd try to resolve the jitter issue.So for now, the Cintiq sits above the keyboard, smaller LCD to the right, and Intuos3 on a little table to the right of my chair. When I use PhotoShop, Painter, etc., my canvas is on the Cintiq, and the controls are on the other LCD screen. I'm still relying on the Intuos3 mostly for painting with my pens (I have 2 Grip pens because one came with each tablet, a Classic pen which I bought because of its small barrel that fits well in my small hand, and the Art pen), but in areas that call for precise brush strokes, I lean forward and paint directly onto the Cintiq. The brush behaves just a tad differently on each of the two tablets, so occasionally I'll need to reset the brush parameters, but maybe that's just me. I'm still trying to decide what kind of workspace setup I need to best utilize all my tools, but as far as the Cintiq goes, it's responsive and even clearer than my other monitor. Once it was synchronized with the pens, there's no problem whatsoever with brushes in relation to the canvas, but then I'm used to using a tablet as my mouse pad for everything, including browsing the net, and I think not being used to a tablet may be the problem for some who try the Cintiq. I'd like to have it laid flatter and placed like Jeremy Sutton's with the Cintiq on a low table so that I can use it more like an actual canvas, but I might have to give up some of my other elements, so we'll see how things evolve.I gave it 5 stars because the Cintiq is everything it's supposed to be, and any issues relate to my personal setup and preferences.
I bought this book expecting a dictionary which would give equivalents of various lexical items throughout the Indo-European language family, with representation from at least one language from each branch. Instead, what we have here is a book whose title SHOULD have been &quot;Dictionary of English word equivalents in Germanic and Greek&quot;. About 95% of the &quot;Indo-European&quot; explained here comes from these languages. Next in frequency is Latin.There are only a handful of references to Celtic, Sanskrit and Russian (only very basic and obvious correlations for the latter), plus only one Iranian word I could find. Armenian? Albanian? Tocharian? Baltic? Anatolian languages? Hah, forget it!This book can only be recommended to those people interested in English or Germanic word origins, rather than those interested in a truly balanced overview of Indo-European. For everything else it is totally inadequate.
The Sony Dream system is perfect for consumers that want a good sound quality...but don't feel like shelling out mega-bucks for a home theater system. Like the earlier reviewer mentioned, you get what you pay for. One dislike that I have is that the changing from disc to disc seems to take an extended amount of time. Also, there really is no way to tell which disc is in which slot...unless you fumble through all of them to find the movie, or audio disc that you are looking for.Good system for the money.
I just bought 2 more of these for my digital camera and am continually impressed by, for a lack of a better phrase, never thinking about these. They work flawlessly in my camera and computer. Read, Write, Repeat. Over and over and over.I'm a big fan of their products now and have been using them for a couple of years.
Well, as a Johnny Thunders fan, I love this because live JT on video/DVD is a rarity. Unfortunately, JT is completely strung out, LITERALLY performing with his eyes rolled into the back of his head for 3/4 of this half-hour long DVD. This is for Die-Hard fans ONLY.As another reviewer pointed out, this was obviously a direct video to DVD transfer. No chance that THIS was going to be "remastered!" The sound-mix is AWFUL. For example, during Pipeline the bass track is WAY in front, burying whatever JT was playing! That is his signature tune and we hear the BASS! The editing is crappy, but I have a feeling a good 1/2 hour of footage spared us seeing JT at his rock-bottom worst. As someone who LOVES his music, I don't wanna see that anyways.JT had to lie down for a good five minutes...at least he continued singing, though. Walter Lure and the rock-steady bass player hold things together as best they can and the drummer does an admirable job (though he apparently never learned to end a song with a flourish...a few songs end with muted tip-taps).That is my review. If you are reading this you will definitely want it, since the only people who would bother to THINK about purchasing In Cold Blood are Die Hards. You can find this regularly on ePay for less than $10, so happy viewing!
My wife and I almost over looked this film as the title and cover picture made us think it was one of those exploitive movies. We are glad we did finally buy it and loved it so much we bought the DVDs available of Tyler Perrys stage plays. This man is a genius as a writer, an actor, a director, and a producer. It is refreshing that such a strong Christian can get his message across the way he has been doing for about a decade now. The film is the most spiritual commecially made film we have ever seen outside of some of those made by groups like the Billy Graham Association. The acting and music is superb. There is a definite message that is mixed with drama and comedy. You will love Madea. We have recommended this in our church and every place where someone will listen to us.
Perhaps I began this book from the wrong perspective. This was a story beloved of me as a little girl. I truly looked forward to reading this as an adult to give me the Wicked Witch of the West's perspective. While the book does have it's humorous points, it is definitely fantasy. If you liked Lord of the Rings, you may love this. I was really disappointed in the whole thing. It wasn't what I expected at all.
Just finished the book, and then re-read some of the reviews here, and I agree with most of them. Overall, I found it to be really exciting and great historical fiction. I wasn't very 'into it' at first, but was completely rewarded with my patience during the last 250 pages or so. Also, it has one of the best chase scenes that I've ever read. Though, I have to agree with the review that indicated that Silva spends a little too much time developing characters without fully using what he's come up with. That being said, I would recommend it - it was fun read...
When the then Pamela Digby Churchill (later to be Pamela Churchill Harriman) shocked British and European society with her string of marriages and romantic alliances, she was actually following more in the footsteps of an ancestor than blazing new ground. Over a hundred years before Pamela romped her way through Europe and America, the Honorable Jane Digby, Lady Ellenborough was embarkening on a series of affairs that drove her from England and eventually to the desert where she spent her final years.Mary S. Lovell could have potrayed Jane Digby as a heartless tramp or made her a cartoon maneater that wouldn't be out of place in a Jackie Collins novel. At times, Jane Digby's life does seem larger than life and more like a daytime soap opera. Her lovers included crowned heads of states and even her own beloved cousin. Her final years were spent as the wife of a Beduoin chief, performing the traditional female duties while the tribe was traveling. Luckily, Mary S. Lovell is a carefully biographer who sorted through masses of documents to find the truth behind the rumors and legends.Along with the legacy of her scandals, Jane become a mother several times. Her children, mostly seen as more annoyance than objects of affection, where left with their fathers when Jane moved onto her next adventure. Tragically, one of her daughters succumbed to madness and two of her sons died in childhood.If you adore biographies or have come across the name Jane Digby in your reading, &quot;Rebel Heart: The Scandalous Life of Jane Digby&quot; is must read.

Finally, the author(s) is veering, albeit slowly, away from the adolescent sexual tension in the novel. We finally get to see Kane actually kiss Bridget Baptiste! For a moment I thought the entire universe was gonna slip into chaos the way it was drummed up so much! Please continue to leave out the excess juvenile hyperepressive sexual tension, and maybe we'll see these two get through this SOON with some good greasy sex for a change, okay? Same goes with Domi and Grant! Nevertheless I do not agree with some of the other real reviewers that the characters were cartoonish, since I always expected this series to portray the good and bad guys with little or no complexity. Mainly because it was the storyline and action in this alternate future that I was keying into. Understand this -- that I've always expected this series to play out as a slightly more polished version of a comic book story; and I haven't been disappointed yet. Hey, if you want some deep soul-searching characters, read Emily Bronte or Dickens, or some other old claptrap. Or rent a &quot;chick&quot; flick, were someone is always dying and there are lots of silly tears being shed. Boo-HOOOOO!For me the characters are complex enough, and I'm glad their relationship is smoothing out some. I also hope the author eventually gets out of this dreamy adventure deal with the three Chintamanti stones. Or else use them as toilet paper or something more useful at least, as it's beginning to get truly boring. I'd also like to see this series depart from the rigid blind formula which I'm sure the publisher ratchets the author(s) into, by the insistence that there shall always be the usual three-strikes-and-yer-out, slam-bang-bang wham-o-bham-o action in each book. For this particular series I don't think that's necessary. For instance, I don't think the series would be hurt any if at least one installment more heavily lent itself to more intricate plotting -- maybe even turn itself into more of a Tom Clancy type spy/suspense thriller (like when they traveled back to a past in New York). Something more cerebral in future volumes would instantly raise this series to untold heights of excellence. If Outlanders contained the complexity of a William C. Dietz or David Drake SF military novel, it would help. I believe Lakesh and his group need to find more sources of information, in the form of time-trawled characters, to keep the series alive with new ideas. The Chintamanti alternate worlds is already getting quite tedious and boring. So that's going to have to be put to bed soon, if not sooner. More historical data is going to have to come from more believable and legitimate sources, rather than this miasmic alternate world drivel, I think.
...now what do you think of when you think of the word "music"...think very carefully about this word now...does it have to be a consonant and structured melody? Or is it complex dynamics and articulation with plenty of keychanges that truly make music the enigmous wonder that it should be? Now if you are looking for either with the least bit of dignity...turn around...and if you could break something on the way out you'd be helping me alot......Avril started her career as one of those young stars...the only difference is MTV decided to label her as "Punk" so people would be decieved into thinking that what they listened to was "fresh" and with "attitude" that and they thought "hmm...maybe we can make up for the abysmal role models in the past by making someone who seems like they'll rebel to authority only to be controlled by us? Ah-ha! Pure hypocrisy on a cake!! Genius!!!" And what we heard were whiney melodies and complaints of a girl (who is actually older then me I might add) that thinks because she has an MTV contract she has an excuse...I'll admitsome of the stuff was mediocore in melody...complexity?(that's not was this music is for however) but of course it soothed some people to think that punk had a soft and decomposed side so I left it alone...to rot of it's own accord and watch the people drink the milk from it's pointless metaphorical udders......but then...we have this...the irony in the title is astounding so I won't even mention it...congratulations...she's got more money for the money machine and let me explain why she's done it (finally get to the point...idiot)......now one in fifteen of you would be considering buying this without even listening to the lead single "girlfriend" and to you people that would be a big mistake if you have for some coincidence never heard it let me describe it to you...let's say a cheerleader pured ink into her eye...picked up a microphone...decided to embarass an insecure prepubescent boy by saying that she's attracted to him and then running him over with a lawn mower...poor child...another life gone...but yes...the chorus is reminiscent of the song "hey nicky!!" and instead is about how her envy and vanity get the better of her and she wants to steal someone elses boyfriend...well done Avril...you raised the bar...there's even an awful R'n'B impersonation after the second verse...aww...I just struggle to find respect for someone who doesn't even know how to tweak an ostinato in the slightest...yes Avril leave it be...and us music snobs will be all over you (oh come on! You know it's true...we're jerks!! Haha...because I'm not american it sounds stupid when I say that...but anyway I'm rambling...) but yes...awful awful sound...plus she stole the idea from a least sucessful song that attempted to sue her...they failed...there's a lesson there...you can't knock a giant down with a bowling pin...merely a shield case...very simply don't try and beat her...she has the subliminal sheep on her side......and yes besides that song there is a simple ballad (chords required are merely one digit)...and other stuff...my advice is...if you are a little boy or girl and want something to dance around to until you know better...then please be my guest...I'll be here being pretencious and listenting to stupid noise and calling it art...she's not a teenager any more...she needs to develop talent...beyond mainstream...but yeah whatever it doesn't matter...no one will read this review and give it a negative comment just to start an argument right? That would be rude...and trust me...I did listen to this...my younger cousin loves it...
This is a nice toaster oven -- and I've had my fair share! The only thing, like other reviewers said, is that the metal behind the handle gets VERY hot. There isn't a lot of room to grab the handle, so it's really easy to graze the tops of your fingers and get a nice little burn. I do like the way this oven cooks...very even. I use it for EVERYTHING, so I'm anxious to see how it holds up!
David Lynch has never been known to make movies for the masses. it seems like, you either love his work, or you hate it. This movie is a prime example. I have never seen a reviewer with mixed feelings about Mulholland Drive. Either you think it's garbage, or you think it's genius. I happen to be in the latter group. I will freely admit, it took two viewings for me to fully 'get' this film. and even now, a couple of years after i saw it for the first time, i am picking up subtle 'clues' and aspects to the film. that is rare in this day and age of 'cookie-cutter' hollywood movies. The plot is far too complicated and twisty to get into, and frankly has been gone over with a fine tooth comb already on this site. But, i will point out that one of the main highlights of this film for me, was the performace by Naomi Watts. She literally plays two different characters...completely different from each other, but the same. She is able to convey more emotion with just her facial expressions towards the end of the movie, then some actresses can with their entire body. This movie is a revelation on many levels. One of the best movies ever made. Period.
This is a cheap and quick book to pick up. No fluff, little cost.It won't make you into a security expert overnight, but it provides a welcome insight into the PS security architecture, especially when it explains which metadata tables are involved in it. And I appreciate not being forced to read more pages than necessary.In fact, I will cite another, one star, reviewer to explain exactly why I think it is worthwhile:"I'm disappointed with this book. PeopleSoft PeopleBooks and Red Papers provide better explanation. The author, for the most part, did not add any value. I wasted $20 on this book. "Sure, Peoplebooks is free. But how often does PeopleSoft literature warn of pitfalls in the products? And, given most consultants' hourly billing rates, they can more easily afford $20 than to wade through dozens of pages of sparsely informative vendor docs.For the record, I have been working with PS for 15 yrs and know most of the common PeopleTools tables like the back of my hand though I wasn't as familiar with security. I don't find this to be dumbed down at all. If you fully know the stuff already, great. If not, this can be a useful addition to your bookshelf.
Like many other women with silver-y streaks, I've tried most of the "silver brightening"-type shampoos available, from inky blue-violet to creamy lavender in color, from low to very high in price. This is the best I've tried and I'm sticking with it. It's mild, cleansing, subtle enough in color concentration to use daily, with a pleasant, light fragrance. To top it off, the huge bottle is one of the best beauty bargains around. I have a lot of fine, wavy, unprocessed hair; I usually use this without a conditioner to avoid flat-hair syndrome, but if your hair is dry or highlighted, check out the conditioner too. The conditioner is more strongly scented, too much so for my liking, but tastes differ and it is cheap enough to try without regret.
It's Altman at his best, with a cast that clearly believed in him and relished the opportunity to be directed by him. This movie is as close to cinematic poetry as you're ever gonna get. Altman demonstrates his gift and mastery at mood, texture and tone, while skillfully adding rich layers of nuance and wit to this somewhat simple tale of a complex man -- or is McCabe a simple man in a complex tale? Beatty and Christie are nothing less than inspirational, and Carradine makes me cry (his earnest commitment the character and the haunting believability that results should be studied by every wannabe actor seeking the true goods). Such confident, restrained, detailed and thus moving filmmaking from an American master -- Altman never made a more beautiful film. Oh, to have been at least a background player in this experience (for Altman even approached their roles with a thoroughness that adds to the piece's overall realism and sense of actual community); a dream job for any performer. And Cohen's music works wonders with the film's atmosphere; I can't think of anyone else who coulda pulled it off more compatibly -- Neil Young maybe? Willie Nelson? Overall, I can't say enough about this one. I watch it each year, and it never fails to enhance my love for it in new ways every time.
This movie is definitely Shyamalan's best yet. I don't really understand all the negative reivews. Or maybe I do - too many people are so used to shallow face-paced modern movies that they can't handle a simple, well told story. The movie does a great job of capturing the essence of the human feelings that drive each of the characters to do what they do, and overall I found it very satisfying, and believable. Also, the script contains a lot of great lines, where it is not just what is said, but the peculiar way that it is said, that gives us deeper insight into how the characters' see the nature of their lives. This is definitely one of my favorite movies in recent years.
I have been looking at this style of ring for awhile. Not for a wedding band, but something to wear. I was about to buy this ring on another website where they say to buy only Edward Mirell and not cheap knockoffs, but decided to check Amazon first. I was taking a chance since this ring was about 150 dollars less, but upon receiving the ring it is stamped Edward Mirell. The only difference I can see between this ring and the other ring is that the barrels are not connected to the sides with little strips of titanium. Maybe this is an early version of the ring that Amazon is trying to sell off at a low price?The ring is handsome, seems perfect. I got a size 11 and the ring does seem to run big. I am able to make it work though. It is light like a titanium ring should be. The cable is awesome. The thickness of the ring is what I will have to get used too. The titanium part of the ring is thick, then the rope sticks out above the ring, and then the barrels are even higher. I can definitely feel it on my hand right now, but hopefully I will get used to it.I'm going to be pessimistic and say that this ring won't hold up for a long time. It seems really solid, but I have to wonder how long the cable will hold together. I will update my review if something happens, hopefully it will remain as awesome as day one.
I was really disappointed in this package. Some of the episiodes play, some flutter and freeze, and some just won't play at all. I hate two-sided dvds and this one is just bad.When they DO play, the picture is really good. ( I never could get the haircut episode to play all the way though, and I tried it on two differents dvd players.)
I've always been a huge fan of the Ramones, but this album is junk. The best thing on it is &quot;Carbona Not Glue&quot; (great lyrics!), whihc was cut off of one of their earlier albums after a lawsuit. On thw hole, this album doesn't sound very good, and it is certainly not the Ramones at their best. It doesn't do justice to their talent. Stick to the studio albums if you want to know what these guys are capable of.
What makes this book so rare and, in my opinion, delectable, is it's seamless fusion of biography, history, philosophy and just plain engrossing storytelling. Very few books can do that, let alone do it as beautifully as this one.Its underlying theme is the intertwining lives of psychologist William James, jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes, and philosophers Charles Peirce (pronounced 'pers') and philosopher John Dewey. Together (yet seperately)they created a philosophy called Pragmatism. The title, I warn you, is a bit misleading. The Metaphysical Club refers to a club that met, consisting of these and a few other members. When I say briefly, the clubs existence in this book takes up maybe 40 pages, so to call the book by that title may give the reader is distorted view of its contents.Much more than philosophy and biography is covered in this book. The author has a tendency to wander off track. For example, Charles Peirce, early in his career, testified in a trial over a will supposedly forged and the author spends a good chapter on the trial alone, rarely mentioning Peirce. Also towards the books beginning, we hear much more about the Civil War itself than Holmes role as a combatant. Put briefly, if you are looking for a book strictly introducing and explaining pragmatism, this is not the best book. Pick up The Pragmatism Reader, edited by Menand. You could also simply read the last three chapters of this one, which contain one of the best outline of pragmatism outside of James and Peirce that I've read.If, though, you have the time and interest to hear great stories and learn some new things, this is a first rate book. The characters come to life (especially Peirce and Holmes) and if you stick through untill the end, you will find that the book, albeit in a round-about fashion, DOES offer us a good look into pragmatism and its galvanizers. See, one of pragmatisms core 'tenets' is that ideas can't be well understood when seperated form context. We form ideas only as guides for action in the existing world, so ideas without situational reference is like a table without a base. In order to understand how pragmatism got started, then, we must need context. Now the discussions mentioned above about the Civil War and the trial over the will do not seem like asides, but rather as necessary to understanding the whole.As I said above, this book is an extrememly well written, entertaining and erudite look at America and it's first native philosophy. Higly reccomended. (If you like this get Branden's "My years with Ayn Rand" and Magee's "Confessions of a Philosopher."
I love this CD, it conveys such a Holy reverance and praise I play it all the time in my Massage Therapy practice. It produces such a Sacred Space that it transcends time and place, it will transport one from whatever enviornment they are in directly into the Holy of Holies. There are wonderful tones and Gregorian chants, beautiful voices, praises, there is a holy silence included. I just highly recommend this CD, Constance Demby has risen to be one of my favorite composers and artist. She is very intune with Heart and Spirit and was very open to GOD to be the vessel to create this wonderful work of Sacred Holiness and Healing.If one closes their eyes and listens to this CD you will be raptured to such Heavenly highs and peace it will bring Healing to your Soul. It is a deep song of the soul that is recorded here. GOD be Praised and you be Blessed....JB
A must read for any military history buff. This book reveals the origins of US Navy traditions and proud combat record. As a person stationed aboard the USS Enterprise during Preying Mantis It was nice to get another account of the action.
The book offered a glimpse into a past lifestyle and I found it interesting. Perhaps a little silly and could have included more history but all in all I enjoyed it.
Amazon need to get the 'Deserves an Effort remix'. I wont chance this.
All the fun of the ball popper push toy without all the ruckus! The chimes are actually very pretty and quite soothing if you ask me.
just lately I hope that Megan Mcdonald will get to on set for Judy Moody and the not bummer summer and probaly just twirling in circles turns in to a jucoozie and name the next book JUDY MOODY AND THE MOOD ABOUT JUCOOZIE
Time travel is one of my favorite science fiction categories and Doomsday Book does not disappoint in this area. It's very much character based though and anyone seeking a high tech novel should look elsewhere. About all we learn of the time travel method is that there is a device called "the net" which makes it possible to travel back in time for fixed durations and you have to return to the physical location where you arrived in order to come back to the present.The novel is initially set in mid 21st century England where Kivrin is a history student seeking to go back to the period about 20 years before the onset of the Black Death. One of the things that is made clear from the start is that mid 21st century England isn't exactly a paradise. It seems to rain all the time and there has been a recent devastating pandemic. No one has ever been back as far as the fourteenth century and Kivrin's teacher, Dunworthy, is understandably concerned about traveling there. The trip is made, however, and everything seems to go well until we discover that she has actually been sent to the year 1348, just before the Black death reaches her location. Efforts to locate and rescue Kivrin are complicated by the sudden outbreak of a virulent flu epidemic which disables virtually all the people connected with the time travel project.While fairly slow moving, this book gives an excellent picture of what life in the mid fourteenth century must have been like and in many respects it's not too different from the present day. While there are obviously many technological aids available in the 21st century we see that both time periods are almost equally disabled by a disease outbreak.In general I liked this book a lot but it could possibly have been a bit shorter and still delivered the same impact. A good read though.
I really looked forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, it is virtually un-readable. There is little insight into the personality of Walter or the times and places he lived. One may say the book is well-researched, but one may also say the authors are [nitpicky]. The book gets bogged down in minutiae such as documenting each take Walter ever recorded and detials right down when, during a recording he changed harps. Sometimes very interesting, but ulimately this over-load of detail makes the book very dry and difficult to read.
These are easily the best presentation of the Fleicher Superman Cartoons I've seen so far. Even Terror On The Midway has been restored!! No kidding, until now, all I'd seen were still pictures representing the first minute of the episode. Now, it's all back.Also, there is no noodling with the sound to make it "booming". It's mono and perfect. The picture quality is the best of those I've seen so far (I've seen the laser discs, the Nature vs War...versions and the 3 pack with Popeye).Only ONE downside. After each chapter starts, a small title on the bottom of the screen comes on telling us when it was originally released in theatres. It's short but unexpected and, no matter what anyone says, an alteration. This...keeps it from being perfect, but they are...good.4 stars!
Zach Braff is one talented motherf-er. He has such a good ear for blending music with the emotional state of a scene. EVERY damn song in this movie goes along so well. I bought the soundtrack and made 10 copies to give out to my closest friends. it also led me to buy actual albums from the artists. Great job Zach. If it wasn't for you, Frou Frou, The Shins, and many more would've remain unheard.
YES if my favorite band and perhaps that's because I heard them before Starcastle. However, had I heard Starcastle first, they might have been my favorite band. I love ANYTHING Starcastle does, and they are greatly gifted and highly talented musicians and singers. Starcastle will always be in my collection of prog-rock!
This is exactly what I've been looking for. If you are looking for upbeat, in your face, soon to be classic tracks...pick this up. This mix is on point.
The price here is similar to that at my local grocery store, but they don't all carry it. If you live out in the boonies you may have to order it, but believe me, it's worth it! Better yet, have your local grocer order it. These crackers are addictive, but you don't feel like you've indulged in junk after munching on them. The balance of nutrients is ideal, and you can taste how fresh the ingredients are.Triscuits, wheat thins, and other mass-produced crackers may look like they have similar ingredients, but they simply taste like cardboard compared with these little rectangles of divinity!
I have been very happy with this little radio. It pulls in stations well, has an excellent speaker in case you want to share the music or program. Lots of handy feature such as LOCK button and separate antenna wire. Great for emergencies.
I was a bit hesitant about reading a book from a C Actor like Chris Elliott. I'm not dissing him, I think he's hilarious, but he just hasn't done much.Thwacker is a great read, the humor is absurd and I actually did laugh out loud on a few occasions. If you like Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey, you'll love this book, it's basically that same silly humor expanded into a novel.Buy it!
L&eacute;o Ferr&eacute; (24.8.1916 - 14.7.1993) at his best. Words here are pure rage against this world of money and compromission. No more life like this one ! We'll get all, the whole things, the power... In 10 000 years !!!
This is a well written biography of Lee's best Corps commander. James Longstreet's place in history has always been shrouded in controversy; because he became a Republican after the war due to the fact some Southerners were unable to accept hearing Longstreet endorse the 13th and 14th Amendments, and taking postings from his old friend Grant. Thus he was spun into the manufactured history known as the Lost Cause for these sins. For his sins racist and Lost Cause proponent Jubal Early started creating the falsehoods to destroy Longstreet's reputation, by blaming him for the Confederate army's loss at Gettysburg, and his Republican politics; calling him a traitor. It is too bad so many people today think negatively of Longstreet because of the lies created by people who wanted to ruin his military reputation because they could not accept the implications of these new amendments and his attempt to participate in government in order to heal the nation.I first read this biography back in the 1990s, and now again completely, and got to enjoy again Jeffry Wert's very clear and well structured prose. His research is also quite good, and he seems overall less influenced by Lost Cause writings of the past on Longstreet. I don't really agree with Wert that Longstreet did not support his superiors if he disagreed with them. There really is no record and no proof that Longstreet never supported Lee. The record shows he supported him in every way possible throughout the war. Jeffery Wert's later magazine article citing Longstreet as the best corps commander in Lee's army and how well he got along with Lee is an update to this work. I agree with one of the other reviewers on the point that Wert has a great admiration for Longstreet, and this is evident throughout this book. Especially the fact he was a general "beloved by his troops and depended upon for his wise counsel and military skills by his boss."At this point in the ever increasing writings on all things Civil War, I have to compare this biography to the newer book on Longstreet by LTC Knudsen - The Confederacy's Most Modern General. The Knudsen book adds military analysis of some of Longstreet's techniques, which civilians like Wert are not going to see in the same light, such as Werts belief that Longstreet was in error by not attacking Joe Hooker in Lookout Valley during the Chattanooga Campaign, a long standing myth. The newer analysis shows that Longstreet had already proposed a better operation to block Hooker much earlier by taking Bridgeport, Alabama, and shows Longstreet was very much in tune with what needed to happen at Chattanooga to defeat the Union, rather than what is traditionally said about his performance working with Bragg. I think where Wert is still reasonably fair in his treatment of Longstreet; Knudsen is even more objective from his perspective. He does not cover politics when examining the tactics and strategy.Werts Longstreet is still one of the better biographies of one of the major figures of the Civil War, and a book I enjoyed thoroughly. It was for the early 1990s a positive and better researched book that corrected many vindictive falsehoods about Longstreet by writers who were never qualified to criticize professional military men like Longstreet. It will be one of the must have books to have on Longstreet for long time to come, and is always recommended by Civil War enthusiasts!
No complaints. Quality and construction are decent and it does its job. I am using it to plug an XLR microphone into a Canon DSLR (60D) for video recording. Huge improvement in audio quality.
My sister had kids before me and always mentioned Goodnight Moon. Of course, I ignored her. Now being a mother of two, I can't stop singing the praises of this book. From the time by daughters were about 6 months old they loved this book. The way your voice sounds with the cadence of the story. I buy it for all my friends who are having kids. It's a must for every mother.
This is just what I was looking for; a solid, inexpensive joystick for occasional flight simulator use. I'm an air traffic controller and wanted to get a little experience with flight simulators to get a taste of what the other side does. This does the job without spending a lot of money. There are a lot of better quality sticks out there with fancier features to be sure, but for the price this has been great and I don't have any complaints.
I ordered Petzlife for my dachshund. He had some stubborn plaque/and tartar on his pointed teeth. I brush his teeth several times a week but it would not budge.We applied this for 2 weeks and it must have loosened it up b/c all I had to do was scrape a little bit and it came off. YAY!!!EDIT: I am still using this over two years after my first review. It works great for all my dogs! No dentals yet!
Zyflamend is marketed as an herbal alternative to over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs that are meant to deal with chronic pain from conditions such as arthritis or fibromyalgia. The herbal blend in each soft gel consists of rosemary, turmeric, ginger, Baikal skullcap, oregano, holy basil, green tea, Hu Zhang, Chinese goldthread, and barberry. The herbs were picked due to studies which indicate they can reduce pro-inflammatory hormones and even certain cancer causing agents. Oddly Zyflamend doesn't include glucosamine, which is the supplement that is most often touted as helping joint stiffness or pain. Potential buyers may find it more helpful to also take a glucosamine supplement with Zyflamend.It is important to note that even though Zyflamend sounds like a prescription drug name, it is only an herbal supplement that has not been tested or endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration. Since it doesn't need to go through any sort of rigorous test procedure, the manufacturer of the supplement can make any claim they'd like about how beneficial it will be without oversight. While it's unlikely that anyone would experience any negative side effects from taking the supplement, any potential buyer should still speak with their physician beforehand, especially if they are taking any sort of prescription medication.That being said, Zyflamend does have many glowing reviews from both physicians and patients alike on numerous legitimate health and alternative medicine websites. Some of those same reviews have mentioned increased instances of gas, constipation, and diarrhea however, so anyone with sensitive bowels might want to consider an alternative or take a smaller dosage to begin with.The bottle contains a warning that the herbs in each soft gel are pungent and spicy, and they aren't kidding. Taking a good whiff of the bottle might result in a fit of sneezing and coughing. The recommended dose is two capsules per day, which should be taken with a full meal to offset the "warm feeling" that is somewhat akin to heart burn. Taking a soft gel without any food does give a slightly unpleasant burning sensation, but it isn't anything that would even warrant taking a heart burn tablet.The pamphlet that comes with the bottle also recommends that anyone taking the supplement should stop eating foods that have "pro-inflammatory Omega 6 fatty acids," which essentially means any red meat. That's good health advice all around, but it's especially important here as eating foods that increase inflammatory agents will prevent the supplement from working as it's supposed to.Since a Zyflamend bottle includes a full month's supply at a reasonable price, it's definitely worth a try for anyone wanting to reduce joint pain or just try out these specific herbs to see how it affects them.
.. that anything could be this bizarre and disconnected with reality, and still be funny an entertaining.I went into this movie without any expectations. I was told &quot;It's weird&quot; and even &quot;It's stupid&quot; but such 2 word reviews don't really tell me anything.Anyway, here goes:We start out with our anti-Hero, Donnie Darko, who is leading a bizarre night life. Every morning, he wakes up far away from his bed in his pajamas. He also sees things. Things like giant rabbits. Oh, and air planes fall on his house. Also, time travel.Yes. Weird. Many little things set this apart from other movies. From it's wonderful characterization (Jake Gyllenhaal gives an amazing performance), to it's slow yet not-boring pace. I left the theatre wondering what I just experienced. My mind attempted to make sense of everything, and I realized that is exactly the intention.This movie wasn't pretentiously cerebral, dealing with esoteric concepts. This movie was about the struggle of an immensely intelligent kid who is more than a little crazy. The philosophy comes in the form of his explorations and thought processes. He sees the world so clearly, yet nobody else does.A fascinating look at the mind of a dark young man.
I must recant my earlier 1-star review. While Mr. O's career switches - fund manager to Netfolio back to fund manger -- are still anything but encouraging, one of his stock picking methods is currently working. I discovered this by looking at the portfolio of one of the funds he started. Basically, it's the stuff I own and it's doing better than the averages. (In fact, it's doing better than any fund group except gold and bear market funds.) O'Shaughnessy offers several methods for stock selection based on his analysis of several decades of data.The statistical work may be flawed as others have said but his methods are making money! (In this bear market, that is quite a boast.) His challenges of well-known methods that don't work may be even more relevant. (First rule of investing -- don't lose money.)
I thought that this movie was going to be so funny and a great watch but in fact all it was a bunch of naked parts and sexual behavior. I am a big big fan of the jackass crew and was so excited when I found this. I was very disappointed in what it was about. There were some funny parts that made me laugh but the whole movie is just basically a porn. This is way way more for guys then girls that's for sure. I also wanted to see more of Chris and he has such a small part, that made me sad. I would say rent this movie before you buy it because you may be unhappy with what you get. I am going to just stick with wildboyz and my jackass DVDs.
Ye Gods, what got into the anonymous Publishers Weekly reviewer above?Surface Action was written within a genre that relies more on archetypal characters than rich Faulknerian constructions, where depictions of military action take the place of intricate Tolstoyan plotting. If this sounds unappetizing, well there's no shortage of other things to read. But the fact that you're reading this review probably means that you're unperturbed by the fact that this book isn't a profound meditation on War and Man. I frankly doubt the above reviewer would have much good to say about the entire genre this book resides in.Surface Action's merits are these: it depicts - fairly creatively - a futuristic Venus populated by all manners of frightful beasties, and it features pretty decent naval action. It's short, fast-paced, has some decent plot twists, and is full of action - it's the kind of thing you could polish off in an evening, without the self-important meditation that seems to have peeved our above reviewer so much. Drake, a Vietnam veteran, knows what he's writing about when depicting combat; and he does humanize the action when he can.In short, this is quick clean fun, and a good bargain at its present price.
this is one of the most beautiful discs i have ever had the good fortune to hear. too bad there aren't sound samples, but, believe me, i have not yet met the soul that is not disarmed by this music. if you're living an open life whatsoever, you're sure to find magic here.
I like the stuff that Atom Heart and Burnt Friedman do. The Atom heart site is pretty comprehensive if you want more info. ANYWAY, My Life With Jesus is Blip Gop- basically, they've taken 1-second sound bites from gospel tunes or who knows what and created house-y songs that sometimes incorporate gospel vocals, which are processed into a spacey raspiness. So, it isn't really danceable, and it isn't spiritual. It's just a lot of blips and beats. I like it, prefer the other Geez n Gosh album to this one, but can't say I passionately love either of them. on the other hand, I wouldn't want to listen to gospel any other way.
As a fan of the fantasy genre, I was very happy to read this innovative book, which finally breaks free of the tired conventions authors have been following for years.From the very start, the setting (a magical Venice, in the early 1900s) is a change from the standard Middle Earth ripooffs and medieval castles. Main character Merle is a well-rounded character who acts quite a bit more like an actual person than any heroine in recent memory. And the supporting cast is no slouch, either; in this well-crafted universe, even standard archetypes have been transformed into fresh new personalities.As is required for any magical world, the fantasy Venice is sprinkled with all kinds of mythical objects and creatures, from stone lions and mummy warriors to "mirror phantoms" and mermaids. All of these are described in a way that makes them seem like they could really exist.The constant stream of unique ideas only helps to drive an intriguing plot. Since this is the first in a series, the ending leaves plenty of loose ends for readers to ponder until the translation of book 2.This book's pretty cover art drew me in, but its strong plot hooks and great writing will keep me coming back until the series concludes.
I picked this up used after reading numerous rave reviews, and boy am I glad I did. Alex North is considered one of the greatest film composers, and his "Cleopatra" score is one of my first movie music memories.This album presents the complete score to "Fisherman," which is filled with memorable themes and gorgeous orchestrations. Apparently North used elements of his score for "2001," which was rejected by Stanley Kubrick, in this film. It's a highly entertaining listen and displays a playful ease with the sounds of the orchestra that reminds me of John Williams at his best.The sound can best be described as "Spartacus" meets "Doctor Zhivago." There's a heavy Russian influence, since that's where the film's Pope, played by Anthony Quinn, comes from. The epic music for the Vatican is powerful and stirring without feeling corny or lapsing into stereotypical "religious" sounds.As if that's not good enough, the second disc also has the complete soundtrack album to "Where Eagles Dare," which I thoroughly enjoyed too.
Buying Pampers or Huggies is flushing your money down the toilet. Luvs work just as well at a fraction of the cost.
I found Thandeka's practically written book a breath of fresh air amidst the glut of overtheorized and overwritten studies of whiteness and racial construction in American society. I dare all white critics of the text to find the courage to play Thandeka's "Race Game" and look honestly at themselves as persons of color, with all the pain that this entails, as Learning to be White carefully explores.
I love my Kindle, but I wish I had waited for the Nook. Not only does B&N have over a million books to download but the prices are lower. There are so many books I want but they are not Kindle-ready, Amazon should have been better prepared like B&N. As Kindle owners' we should never come across a book we can't buy for our Kindle, or rarely come across one.
It bothers me that Paul Newman has his name on the DVD cover, but Jackie Gleason doesn't.After all, Gleason plays Minnesota Fats! Who ever heard of "Fast Eddie"?The cover of the DVD shows shots from the movie, but are in color. When you pop the movie in your DVD player however, you discover the movie is in black and white. Why the deception? But old movies seem like they should be in black and white anyway.This is a great movie for those that love pool, but also a good movie for those that know nothing about it, because there is a love story mixed into it as well. In fact, it starts out about pool, then goes into another story alltogether, but at the end goes back to the movie it started out as, about pool.The documentary about the movie is excelent.There is also a section in which someone shows you how all the trick shots in the movie are done. Well he doesn't really show you how to do them explaining what you need to do, but he just does the shots and hopes you are impressed that HE can do them.He should have gone into where you need to hit the cue ball in order to get the shot to work.I still can't figure out why the woman in the movie had to have a walking problem, as the story would have worked just fine without that, seems weird that they made her walk funny for no reason at all, it would have been more enjoyable if she would have just walked normal.DVD does have scene guide inside, some DVDs don't have this, so it is a plus when it is there.
What's not to love about James Garner? We're buying all the seasons. Better than anything on TV now.
Perhaps because it was a new york times bestseller, or because someone I know recommended her as an author, i came to the book with high expectations. The book is a fast, easy read, but it is too lightweight for my tastes. Sure, there are a few memorable episodes, and the author certainly went on a fun adventure, but I didn't walk away from the book feeling like I had really learned something. There are so many great science books out there that have similar scope -- picking an interesting topic and then delving in to detail -- but this one certainly doesn't fall into that category. For example, compared to a book such as Your Inner Fish, this book is more of a beach read.Of course, there are a huge number of folks that don't want more scientific depth, but for me I felt that the author could keep her breezy style but also deliver more "meat" so as to make it a more interesting read.
I have owned this CD for about 12 years and it is the one CD I keep coming back to and listening over and over. This is not a CD you'll buy for just 1 song--the whole thing is great! I cannot get over how well done this music is. The music tells a story as it plays, and while the music is refreshing and new, it rings in the back of your head as just a bit familiar.
Joe Haldeman is one of those authors that always entertains, but the question is: Does he satisfy? In this case I say yes.Camouflage is about two shape shifting aliens. One preferring to be male the other female that have been on earth for thousands of years. One is evil the other is good. They are united in the common goal of an artifact found in the water that might unlock the secret of one, or both. Also we must deal with the people caught in the crossfire of two very powerful beings.It has all the Haldeman touches, exotic locals, a near future and some gritty scenes.Using aliens to comment on the human condition is one of the oldest plots out there (but lets face it there are no new ones) the trick is the spin and presentation each writer gives and Haldeman gives a good one.The ending was touching and funny. Oddly enough I could see this as a James Cameron movie.The book is well worth the read.
I like Robin Williams movies. This was a good one. I love watching Sargent Major Dickerson get his comeuppance, after what he pulled. What a worm!! Robin Williams was the perfect choice for his role as Airman DJ Adrian Cronauer in the movie.
This is my third Walk 'N Cut openner...my only issue is that the battery dies but like most batteries they don't charge after a few years so throw it out and buy another one. The neat thing about this can openner is that it really works...the are or magnet is removable for clean up...my family really likes this openner and is used daily in our kitchen. The best battery one I have found on the market.
"Gettysburg" is perhaps the best attempt by any film to capture a single battle from beginning to end. It is not a movie for everyone since there is no artificially-embedded love story (as in. "Pearl Harbor"), and in fact, there are no women in this movie at all. It sets out to depict the largest battle ever fought on the American continent. Its success is the product of the deliberate choice of the director to respect the source material, namely one of the finest historical war novels ever written, "The Killer Angels", by Michael Shaara.Gettysburg is a battle of superlatives. It was the largest and bloodiest encounter battle of the Civil War, adding up the three days between July 1 and July 3, 1863, and it tore the heart out of the Lee's Army of Northern Virginia.. It is also the most controversial battle, generating more than its share of debates over decisions and tactics. Was Lee off his game at Gettysburg, as Shaara suggests? Or, as other historians argue, was the battle lost by "Old Pete" Longstreet's case of the "slows" on July 2 (the attack on Devil's Den and Little Round Top) and July 3 (Pickett's Charge)? Longstreet's postwar memoirs lay the blame for Pickett`s Charge squarely at Lee's feet, but since Longstreet joined the Republican party after the war, many Southerners are quick to blame him for Lee's defeat.Shaara's book, and therefore the film, makes choices in this debate. Shaara sides with Longstreet (aptly played by Tom Beringer), who is depicted as a thoughtful, reluctant warrior who vocally opposes the sanguinary frontal assaults launched by Lee on July 2nd and July 3rd . (For a different perspective, I highly recommend Noah Trudeau's latest book, "Gettysburg: A Testing of Courage.")It is a delight to see the musty daguerreotypes of Civil War leaders come to life as living, breathing characters. For the Confederates, Tom Berringer's Longstreet is tops, followed by Confederate generals "Lo" Armistead (Richard Jordan) and Stephen Lang `s amazing George Pickett, a stunning contrast to Lang's later alabaster imitation of Christ as Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson in "Gods and Generals." These are interesting, complex people, and "Gettysburg" even manages a sense of humor. The debate on Darwin between Pickett and Armistead is funny, concluding with Pickett defying any Southern gentleman to openly claim that "Robert E. Lee is descended from an ape." On the Union side, there is Jeff Daniels as the bookish hero Joshua Chamberlain, Sam Elliott as the hard-bitten cavalry general Buford, and Brian Mallon's pugnacious General Winfield Scott Hancock.Some die-hard grognards have complained that "Gettysburg" glosses over details of the battle. But Shaara, and the film, were right to concentrate on the highlights: the initial skirmish and ultimate Union rout on July 1, the confused battle for Devil's Den, the Peach Orchard, and the against-all-odds defense of Little Round Top on July 2 by Joshua Chamberlain's (Jeff Daniels) 20th Maine; and, of course, Pickett's Charge. Massive volumes have been written about just one day of the three day battle, and any film which tried to cover it all would be a ponderous bore.The few speeches in the movie are necessary, I suppose, to explain the larger motives for the war. Jeff Daniels' Chamberlain has to give the obligatory Abolitionist speech, and Armistead trys to explain the Southern "Cause" to the English camp follower Freemantle just before Pickett's Charge. The few speeches in `Gettysburg" hint at the malignancy that emerges full flower in "Gods and Generals" (written by a different Shaara) in which the camera's pause on any character become the excuse for a five to ten minutes of pious blather.The flaws of the film are few. One major flaw is Martin Sheen's portrayal of Robert E. Lee as an unblinking somnambulist, whose approach to strategy is by mumbling "it is God's will" as officers rush up with dispatches. Robert Duvall's more animated Lee is the only (and I mean only improvement) that "Gods and Generals" has on "Gettysburg." Sheen's wide-eyed robot Lee is hard to square with the historical brilliance of Lee at Second Bull Run and Chancellorsville, and contemporary accounts of Lee as a witty conversationalist, a battlefield gambler, and with an eye for the ladies.Ted Turner's use of thousands of amateur reenactors to stage the battle is both a blessing and a curse, but mostly a blessing. Let's face it - the authentically-decked out and equipped amateur soldiers look far more like the real thing than the standard Spanish rent-an-army employed in similar epics such as "Waterloo." However, I suspect that the troops in the movie, particularly on the Southern side, are cleaner, neater, better fed and older (lots of retired folks are reenactors) than the actual participants in the battles. (A common observation of the time was that you could smell Lee's troops approaching before you would see them). The other problem with reenactors is they object to having their limbs and heads blown off, or torsos reduced to bloody pulp by cannon balls. This is not "Private Ryan" or "Band of Brothers" - these soldiers, even when blasted by cannon, die clean deaths, and do not convey the historical eyewitness accounts of the horror, not to mention thousands of corpses set out in the hot July sun. But these are very minor quibbles. This is as good a re-enactment using real people as you can expect.I recommend "Gettysburg" for historical movie fans, and do not forget the wonderful Ken Burns' documentary, "The Civil War."
This is a very nice clock and aesthetically pleasing to the eyes, but it could of been so much better if it weren't for the few minor flaws.I bought this because I've been wanting a silent analog wall clock for some time. There are other brands but unfortunately third-party sellers would not honor my Amazon promotion.My main objective was to get a clock that doesn't 'tick' or something with a 'sweeping' second-hand since this is going to be displayed in the living room wall not far off from the television, and the Heirloom 300CS by Timekeeper seemed like the perfect choice. The clock feels pretty heavy mainly due to the domed-glass lens, all this and surprisingly it shipped w/o a battery (I guess that could of added more to the weight). The clock itself is 'frame-less' and the domed-glass lens is secured by four metal clasps wrapped by clear plastic tubings to prevent scratches. The contemporary/classic design of the clock blended well with my home and the size was perfect!Up close, the faux wood face was merely a piece of paper and printed to replicate the effect. It didn't look much like the more contoured (as seen here) with its concave inner circle section, and some areas of the face around the edges (especially on 9:00) is a bit warped and wobbled in. The markers are not as richly detailed, but all in all, the clock works and sweeps quietly as advertised and from a distance, one can hardly notice. Although it is sweep and non-ticking, I can still hear the tiny gears from the mechanism at work if I stand close enough, but ambiance noise usually washes it out.What I don't like:The Hour, Minute & Second hands looked very similar from afar, at a glance I couldn't make the time unless I stare and wait for the 'second' hand to sweep by, then real time focuses in. It is a change for me because I am somewhat used to my other clock displayed in the kitchen (white face w/ numbers and a thinner second hand) due to its contrast. This clock could of been so much better if the sweeping-second hand were thinner, and perhaps put some numbers on the face. The 'minute hand' also has an inconsistent run, at times it would land incorrectly on some markers; ex: a minute faster especially at the 3-marker position, and when it reaches the 7th-9th markers, it would sync up again. I believed this is gravitational due to the weight of the hand; instead of flowing slowing, I can see it rapidly hopped a millimeter down, and when it reaches up towards the 7-9 markers, it would delay until it picks up (or gear-up) again.This pattern seems to fluctuate anywhere from the 1-10 marker positions as I have been monitoring it for the past couple of days while making numerous attempts to get it set up correctly -- not good! Luckily, the clock was purchased with a $17 amazon promotion. Not worth the hassle of returning and loses out on the promo. Amazon did sent out a replacement but that didn't rectify the problem. So, a few bucks ain't bad for a silent sweeping analog clock, but only 'time' will tell on this one.I will revise the review if anything drastically changes.****(update) 04/22/2012****I did eventually returned the clock not long after its replacement. I have tried to make every effort to keep the clock but the 2nd one was losing time at a rate of 3-5-seconds per day. Needless to say I returned it and bought the perfect silent/sweeping clock (Bai Brushed Aluminum Wall Clock), well almost perfect at least. I decided to wait a few months and update this review and I must say that the Bai clock hasn't lose a second and it's been dead-accurate to the minute!
I thought that by using a more natural product that I wouldn't have to worry about my son having a reaction, but I was sadly mistaken. After using this lotion my 3 month old son developed a contact rash which lasted for just over a month, which was very disappointing seeing as I was given quite a bit of Burt's Bees products at my baby shower and now will not use any of them for fear of this happening again. He was covered with red sores on his entire body after one use, and the poor guy was so uncomfortable! After this happened I began reading negative reviews that other mother's had written about this same product. Never again!
Published in 1978. 168 pages. These 77 rules represent the definitive basis of good programming style and best programming practices. Included in this famous set of rules are gems such as "say what you mean", "write clearly", "use the telephone test", "make sure comments and code agree", and "make it right before you make it faster". Each rule is described in the context of a small program or code fragment. The authors expertly illuminate their rules by correcting these deficient programs. All of the example code in FORTRAN or PL/I was taken from prior publications. The rules are programming language independent (76/77); the only exception is "avoid the FORTRAN arithmetic IF." This book solidified many of the ideals expressed in the structured programming movement.
This movie is nothing like the cover, it follows a number different groups of people during a zombie outbreak. This is why I hate Zombie moives with SLOW ASS ZOMBIES!!!!!!!!! A bunch of girls screaming for no reason when they can easily out run the zombies. Theres a scene with some survivors, and they go into town to get supplies or whatever, and they see a few zombies walking towards them, WALKING! Then they start panicing trying to get all the stuff into the car.................. Look, this movie is going to have you questioning a lot of S**t, rather than finding someway to enjoy this film. I gave the movie 2 stars instead of 1 because the idea and the plot was there but it just wasnt executed in the right way. If the Zombies ran, I wouldnt care about the make-up of the zombies and I wouldnt care about the acting......... That much. Waste you time if want!
When I pretend this is really some unknown Bulgarian piece of music, it even sounds nice at times. But then come the all-too familiar and beloved Pink Floyd themes - watered down to fit a 'symphonic' style. Because of this, the CD constantly reminds us of its shortcomings; it simply is not Pink Floyd, and can in no way replace it. Give me some honestly Bulgarian music instead.
Dark, ambient, Trancy, exciting...what more can I say...one of my favorite CD's after 2 years of listening.
this game is one of the best games ever dont listen to those other people who say its bad because they have no tasyte for good games a must have
Here are presented two of Johannes Brahms pure String Quintets, not involving an auxiliary instrument (such as the piano) that is, the opus 88 and the opus 111. I was led to purchase this because of a slight defect in my old recording of the 111, and upon hearing of the 88, and how beautiful it was too (and which I did not have), I therefore decided to purchase this, the B.S.O. recording of both works. And though I paid somewhat of a premium, I am very glad I did buy it.But actually what I learned was that, although the 88 is a beautful work, standing right there with all the rest of his chamber music... it is actually the opus 111 that is truly the outstanding work. One senses here, in this piece, a man attempting to sum up his life, and work, of very many august and elegant compositions. And though neither disappoints (and in his chamber work, really, nothing actually ever does), I thought it was the second that was the truly special, compelling composition. A wonderful CD therefore, heartily recommended. And you know, he almost stopped writing shortly after the opus 111 quintet - that is, until he met with a new instrument - the clarinet.
The main criticisms of this album are only valid if you're only interested in the 'classic' FNM releases featuring the great Jim Martin and prominent keyboards. There ARE keyboards all over the album, unlike some would have you believe...they're just not mixed to the foreground as in other FNM releases. It's a matter of personal choice and open-mindedness as to whether or not you'll enjoy it in comparison. Trey Spruance came up with fantastic guitar parts that are HUGE yet musical and complex, easily as good as (the excellent) Jim Martin's best work. And Mike Patton's vocals are astounding, and clear in the mix, unlike on other FNM releases where he's heavily processed or dripping in reverb (not that there's anything wrong with that!). And the SONGS are great! there's only ONE track i don't like, as opposed to when i listen to 'Album of the Year' which has just a few great songs...
I did a lot of shopping and research before buying a new mouse, decided on the MX700 and I am not disappointed. I had a cordless mouse before (HP brand) that was TERRIBLE, mainly because the batteries were always going dead. Finally, one that can sit in a charger! I bought it for my home PC and liked it so much I bought another one for the office. It is a little on the large side, but my four year old uses the one at home with no problems. He even uses it with his left hand and manages okay, but it is designed for only right hand use. Can't go wrong with this one.
Fans of absorbing dramas such as &quot;JFK&quot; and and &quot;The Conversation&quot; rejoice! As I write this it is March of 2003 and I have yet to watch a truly great movie this year. And then I rented &quot;Traffic.&quot; This is a great, riveting film which avoids almost all the trappings and conventions of film that I have come to hate (Douglas' &quot;I can't do this&quot; speech being the exception). And for once here is a movie that's thought provoking without being obvious (the antithesis of &quot;John Q&quot;). If you like the films of Soderbergh, Oliver Stone, or Michael Mann, I promise you will enjoy &quot;Traffic.&quot; If you don't, email me and ream me out. . .
I am enthralled with the subject of Polygamy and this is a well written book . . . very clinical, informative, factual and dry book - which is why I gave it 2 stars. If the author had cut it down it would have earned three stars from me. I need just a little more heart and soul for me to grant it a better star rating. I enjoyed immensely the 19th wife. I understand this was not that kind of book, but I put this book away 60 pages from completing it, because it had lost my interest and that was not the case with the 19th wife, not even once.
THIS VIDEO IS EASY TO FOLLOW. I HAVE 2 DOG TRAINING VIDEOS BY DIFFERENT PEOPLE, COMMAND PERFORMANCE IS THE MOST SIMPLE AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND, ANYONE CAN TRAIN A DOG WITH THESE VISUAL DIRECTIONS....EXCELLENT.
Arrived in good condition and in a timely manner. Looking forward to viewing it.
All I can really say is that I enjoyed the show. The plot was engaging and the effects were not as bad as some reviwers have stated. They certainly were better than what you usually see on Syfy films. My only complaint is that they should have done more with Leslea Fisher...she is a really good actress (see her indie film called THE LAST KNOWN DOCUMENTARY) and expanding her character would have added a lot to the story line. As it was, they didn't give her much to do and thats a pity.
Shakespeare's Othello is one of the most powerful tragedies in the history of literature. It was only a matter of time until someone got around to making a game about it, and here it is!In this 2-player strategy game, one player plays the role as Othello, the lone black piece on the game board, while the other player assumes the role of Iago. Other characters on the board include Desdemona, Cassio, and Roderigo. While the Othello player traverses the board in hopes of reaching Desdemona on the other side, the intelligent individual controlling Iago will have to quickly find ways to incite a fight between Cassio and Roderigo or have Cassio reach Desdemona before Othello does. Once Othello reaches Desdemona, Iago's previous actions will determine whether or not Othello has come to kill Desdemona. The state of Desdemona's life determines the winner!It certainly is a new and refreshing take on the classic tale, and I'm sure many have wished they could stop Iago's scheming if given the chance. A must-have for fans of Othello.

Not only is this book great, but I wish it had come out sooner. If I'd had this in hand years ago, I'd have saved myself literally years of effort, both as far as just getting things done, but also in learning general Perl skills.You can have any other Perl book on the market, but you're not getting the whole story until you get this one too. This, more than any other one Perl book, is something that can stay with you from the time you're just starting to learn Perl, to when you're an expert at it.
A friend suggested this to me as the first book about autism we should read. Our 2-year old is in the process of being evaluated for autism. This was a perfect book for us. It isn't a guide or reference book, but a gentle opening into the world of autism that I really felt cradled me as I opened my eyes to everything within.This is a lovely, easy read for anyone curious about autism or just looking for a good read.
This is one of the most thorough, well-written, accessible texts on astrodynamics that I've seen. The coverage of spherical harmonics (zonal, sectorial and tesseral) in Chapter 8 is very well done and welcomed. Beginners (or those who need a refresher) will also appreciate the very accessible coverage of Kalman filtering in Chapter 10.The text provides 70 algorithms in addition to the wealth of mathematical derivations throughout the text.The publisher's web site does not provide the updated table of contents for the 2nd Edition (as of 9 May 2006). I have provided this below. I wish that I had the time to provide the section headings within each chapter. However, if you are familiar with the subject area, you will be able to see from the chapter titles that this text is quite thorough.Loaded with well-executed illustrations and clear, descriptive text, I doubt that anything in this text will leave you with questions or confusion.

What can I say? ... It works great and it comes with cables. You can open the box, have a DVD in the tray and be watching it within 10 minutes.Dogs bark in a movie and my Jack Russell ter...rer... OK! ah... er... We can't atribute that to the DVD player. :-) I'll try again: Dogs bark in a movie and the 14 year old corgi wakes up and sniffs! :-) Yea!If you are going to use this DVD player in the bedroom with just a stereo tv, it will work just fine....If you have a home theater set-up with 5 speakers, a Dolby Digital decoder is needed separate the sound and send it to 5 speakers: left & right, front & back and center. This model does not have a Dolby Digital decoder. I'd sort of consider that a moot point. If you have 5 speakers, most probably you'll have a Dolby Digital stereo receiver sitting there with the speakers.If possible, I'd recommend running any DVD player through your stereo receiver. Unless you have a real high-end tv, there is a good chance your stereo speakers are much better quality than any TV speakers.I have 4 foot high speakers (front, back and sideways) and a Harmon Kardon receiver. Apollo 13 took off in my living room. Just as a test of what it would sound like on an old cheap stereo... I plugged in into an old Panasonic ... yard-sale-stereo and... Apollo 13 still took off in my living room!I have a 13" TV. I don't plan to upgrade until I get an HDTV. I refuse to spend $1000 on a TV set unless it cooks dinner. :-) So why get a DVD player now? Even with the great sound...I wanted to buy movies... VHS tape is magnetic and "drops out" in a few years. DVD's (and CD's) won't change unless you leave them on the dash of the car in July.There is tons of information on DVD's in addition to movies. A narration of Apollo 13 by Jim Lovell and his wife. How Carl Sagan's "Contact" was made. (Jodie Foster saying "OK to go" billions and billions of times.) Why Meg Ryan wore red in "Sleepless...." Tibits, gossip, computer animation and special effects techiques. Did you like this movie? Indexes. Other films by the stars and director. Complete documentaries about the subject: On the "Saving Private Ryan" DVD -- what was the real story about D-day?I haven't had any problems with the Pioneer remote mentioned by others. I am glad it is not the size of a bass. It is the size of a trout. Brown trout. Native.It insisted once on replaying the same segment of special effects footage on "Contact" -- no matter what I selected off the special effects menu. I think it was a problem with the programming on the DVD -- not a problem with the Pioneer player. It happened again in the same place when I tried again another day. Both times, I went to main menu and was able to start the special effects menu over. I go through all the bonus materials and that was the only "funny" -- and I have probably watched 60 DVD's with this player.One goodie -- this DVD player will remember where you were at the last time you turned off the movie. If you stop 1/2 way through, a week and 3 movies later it will remember this. My player remembered this even after a 5 hour power outage.Want a spare DVD player for the bedroom or den... Want to justify that HDTV and go digital a few years earlier than planned? Buy this DVD player now and just look at those pretty pictures! Even on a 13" TV, I amHappy watching! CynthiaPS What kind of cables? There are RCA jacks and cables for the audio. Most stereos and stereo TV's have RCA plugs. (2-3 1/4" round metal ring, color coded: red, yellow and/or white.)There is a S-video jacks and cable for the picture. Newer TV's and VCR players have s-video jacks. If you have an older TV with just a coaxial plug (round ring, screws on), you'll need to buy an "RF Modulator" black box. ... Mine came from the mall. A bonus -- the black box acts as a switch between your DVD and your VCR. i.e. you don't have to swap cables on the back of your TV set to go from one player to another.There is a coaxial optical jack on the Pioneer if you have newer equipment. Optical cables are not included -- but, if you have optical, you'd probably want higher-end cables anyway. (And you probably haven't read this far in my review either. :-) Ta! c.
I took a Yellow Nineties literature course in college, and the professor told us to stay away from "Teleny," that Oscar Wilde had nothing to do with it. With my interest piqued, I went to the university library and discovered there was a copy of "Teleny" in the rare book room. I read it in one sitting. I agreed that Oscar Wilde probably had nothing to do with it.But now, many years later, I've read it again, and this doesn't even seem like the same text I read before. I will give Oscar Wilde chapter 7 and a long passage of chapter 8. Beyond that, I'm sure many other writers contributed most of it. I just wish an editor had been involved. While reading this version, I concluded that some kind of optical scanner had been used to transfer the text from one source to another. In the process, very strange things happened. The letter "m" often gets subsituted for "th," so that the word "that" appears as "mat." "Mink" is really "think." But it doesn't stop there. "Concerts" becomes "conceits." "Kiss" becomes "lass." The best one is "mush-scented courtesans," which I hope is supposed to be "musk-scented." Add to that the fact that some French words were just guessed at, so we end up with "mignans," "matrons" for "marrons," and "Angut" for "Angot." Anyway, the text is so corrupted that you practically have to be a cryptographer to decipher it some of it.The early chapters have lots of typical Victorian hetero scenes, but once the homosexual ones start, one must agree that this is a different kind of prose. The literary and classical allusions abound. (Some of them are so obscure that I couldn't find out about them using google search.) There is an attempt at a Poe atmosphere near the end, which is telegraphed from a mile away. The end is "open," with a hint that there might be a sequel, but apparently there never was one.In all honesty, I cannot recomment this New Traveller's Companion Series version (no pictures) because of the constant typos and bizarre punctuation that render the prose almost unreadable.
The music and lyrics for this album were written almost exclusivly by Chantal Kreviazuk, and it shows.The album rolls along smoothly and nothing feels like it's coming at you from left field, as is the case with her first album, Under These Rocks and Stones. Every song, with the exception of 'Soul Searching' which seems a bit forced, comes across as sincere, which is a rareity.My favorite song is 'Eve' because of the mood it captures so perfectly.On the whole, an excellent album!
It would not be hard to contemplate a more difficult story line for Disney to adapt on screen than Victor Hugo's &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;, but that doesn't mean it was a walk in the park either. Not only is there the conundrum of how to make Quasimodo true to his character and at the same time not so unsightly in appearance as to frighten off youngsters, but how will Victor Hugo's dark commentary of 15th Century Parisian life, capital punishment and religious bigotry be accommodated? What of Claude Frollo's lascivious desires for Esmerelda and wanton acts upon Quasimodo and gypsies? And that ending...a bit of a downer don't you think? Well, believe it or not, Disney stays true to each of these facets of the novel...with the exception of the tragic conclusion, of course.Talking gargoyles aside, the film really does not do enough to accommodate young viewers (and perhaps it was a mistake to market this as a kid's movie, but you got to sell those Burger King toys somehow!). The villain (Frollo) is among the most sinister characters ever portrayed in a Disney movie, and unlike Jafar (&quot;Alladin&quot;) or Hades (&quot;Hercules&quot;), there is nothing humorous about him. On the other hand, the animators went a little overboard with Quasimodo, who kinda looks like a red-headed Chris Farley. And Phoebus has the personality of Al Gore...if he were any more wooden you'd have to check him for termites. Also, some very interesting characters from the book are regrettably absent. Where's Pierre Gringoire, Jehan Frollo, and Sister Gudule? Still, the animation is breathtaking, and the finale is nearly flawless...preferred to original version if you're a sentimental fan of happy endings.The movie contains a few hilarious subliminal references, as when Quasimodo (Tom Hulce) is dressed up briefly as Amadeus. The music is incredible and supports the film's most compelling scenes: Esmerelda singing &quot;God Help The Outcasts&quot; while taking sanctuary in the cathedral, the counterpoint of Quasimodo's &quot;Heaven's Light&quot; to Frollo's &quot;Hell Fire,&quot; and the heart-pumping score behind the finale. Probably would have been given a PG rating if not for Eisner's influence over MPAA.
Just finished taking NET,did not need Kaplans book, and neither will you if you prepare properly.Test is not that difficult,bone up on % and decimals and you will be ok with math.Kaplans book is loaded with two much useless information.
I am not the target audience for this book (I was looking for strength training exercises to augment a cardio work out to improve muscle tone / "deplete" fat -- at 56 I'm not expecting to look like the cover model anytime soon) and bought it after a few minute scan mostly because of the range of exercises it contained. Then I started reading it while on the exercise bike. I found the theory fascinating -- and really appreciate the balanced persepctive (e.g., presenting both sides of the debate on stretching). I love the authors advice that in the end you do what you want with the exercises (but the program laid out is what has been shown to work in years of practice). For those who may have to modify the routines (due to bad backs etc.) it helps get you into the program. But since I have more time on the bike than in the bookstore, I've been reading. And as I read I started adventuring into some of the exercises I thought I should not do with a bad back (Thank you Mr. King!). I'm hopelessly out of phase with the week by week program, but if you are looking for a lifestyle change vs. a quick fix, there is enough material here to help you get there.My only caveat is that books are not a substitute for a personal trainer (who can see and correct what you are doing wrong). I'm playing it safe with the exercises -- when in doubt, skip it. If you are in a hurry to look good for your honeymoon, you might want profesional help. But I am hoping that this book will be a very long term investment.
I made it to page 150 of Haunted and almost threw the book away. My wife decided she'd give it a shot and didn't make it as far as I did. This book truly stinks. If it gets scary at some point you'll likely never know it because the ridiculous romance will be so off putting that you too will feel foolish for having bought the book.No kidding. Go find an old Casper the Ghost comic before you buy this terrible thing. How did this get published?Wow!Oh! Heather? By the way. C14 dating doesn't apply to artifacts that are 100 years old. At least try to get the science straight.
I've read all of the Ranger Anna series, and while the subject matter here is difficult, I think this is one of Barr's best efforts. I especially noticed that this is not the kinder gentler Anna that some may have expected when she finally tied the knot. Language is courser, (but appropriate) and the introduction of a "second in command" was an interesting twist. One expects that Barr might be priming wheelchair bound Heath (has anyone ever heard of a girl named Heath before???) for her own series of mysteries.
What can I say about this product. Not real fancy. Just a practical cell phone cover.Does a good job of protecting your RAZR. All connections are not impeded.Great cell phone cover for the price.
The condition of the book is very good.It is almost new.My daugther likes the book.
I personally think that Elize's "Shake" is a better song than Dannii Minogue's "Put the Needle On It." I love both, but Elize's track has better vocals, an awesome backbeat, and one of the catchiest choruses to hit dance/pop music in quite a while. "Shake" is very likeable, because people who enjoy dance/club/house music will enjoy it, as well as people who like pop, i.e. Britney Spears, Kylie Minogue, Madonna, etc. I hope Elize releases an album, because if all of her songs sound like this one, she'll be a superstar in no time.
THIS WAS SOME STALE A$$ CRAP, VERY UN INTERESTING, AND REDUNDANT LYRICS, A COUPLE OF BEATS WERE OK, BUT THAT WAS IT.LYRICALLY THESE GUYS JUST CAN'T BRING IT, AND THEY'VE BEEN AROUND FOR SOME TIME NOW. THE BEATS DIDN'T REALLY KNOCK AS HARD AS I THOUGHT THEY SHOULD'VE, LETS FACE IT RAP FROM THE SOUTH IS USUSALLY KNOWN FOR ITS HARD BASS, AND BAD FLOW, AND LYRICS, BUT THIS ONE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE HARD BASS, IT WAS KIND OF DISAPPOINTING. STRAIGHT BOO BOO
I too got turned on to Diana Wynne Jones after the Howl's Moving Castle anime. I read her Chrestomanci series first and now I finally read this book. Many reviews have already done a decent summary, Sophie, the eldest of 3 sisters is resigned to the fate of the fairy-tale trope 'eldest child' who stays home and isn't successful. Even from the beginning however, DWJ shows that she's bent on turning tropes on their heads. The step-mom is young, pretty and kind to Sophie. The step-sisters love each other, the most beautiful and beloved sister isn't the main character but one of the other sisters, etc.The main problem I had with the story is that a lot of 'obvious' things weren't obvious at all, especially Calcifer's clues. Even though I knew from the anime what the 'contract' was supposed to be, his hints were so vague that I ONLY knew they were hints because i had knowledge before-hand.Near the ending, a million characters come out of nowhere and it's frustrating when all the readers want to see is Sophie and Howl have their moment with 20 people interrupting and pulling at their sleeves.Howl wasn't a very enticing character and I really wasn't rooting for a romance while reading the book, the 'moment' at the end was super rushed as if DWJ was saying 'Oh yeah, here's the obligatory fairy-tale romance at the end.'All in all i think it was one of DWJ's best efforts. I'd recommend watching the anime first because DWJ is not very descriptive at all, the story is very action-oriented.
I have used these as well as the 2 and 2.5"in my bostich N62 finish nailer....They have worked without a hitch. Sometimes it is the "nailee" not the nails that have problems.....
This is a fantastic book! The best of it's kind! Great colored photos and information (not too much, but just enough)! I like to hike & camp in the Mojave desert, and I love this book!
I'm no prude but bad writing and weak plot lines do not drive repeat sales.I've never been more disappointed with a book, make that last four in the series. When I first got introduced to this series the characters were so vivid and neatly drawn that each additional titile revealed more but still left substancial mystery to the on-going story. But these last few titles have dropped to bad porn writing, the sex is too techinical and the characters are now bad reflections of what they were in the begining. I mean Ms, H really needs to read Anne Rampling's aka Anne Rice's Beauty Series to learn how to write erotica or pick up a copy of Dave Benbow's Hunk House for some real fun and quick sex scenes. I can honestly say that I intend to drop Ms. H from my must read list, talk about good money thrown away on empty words.
This book was an excellent tool for introspection. It has safe and wonderful easy EASY practices that allow you to work gentally at becoming whole. There are explanations to change the way you deal with your emotional and spiritual bodies to heal and become more connected. This book is not for those that want to achieve power but rather impowerment. It is a book that is based on the idea to heal the childhood and the innerchild.
BB King with amazing voice and amazing songs, Finaly i say - its been 2 years sence his last album. Very good - and the last song on the CD is great. Anyone who has good taste in music will be pleased with this album. Those who are expecting Blues will be disepointed though. A Wonderful man brings us a wonderful album.
Spore brings a new level to gaming with a fun mix of creativity, strategy and infinite variety.The game play is fun and extremely addicting. For me, creating the creatures, the wide variety of buildings, land, sea, air and space vehicles and even your civilization's "national anthem" is very satisfying. This really is a universe as your toy box.And the replay value is wonderful because there are a wide variety of play styles you can use. And each results in different types of options available when building your creatures and their amenities.As for the copy protection, too many people are popping veins over it: I paid for the game. I've NEVER had to reinstall a game more than once, but if I DID run out of installations, I would simply download the pirated version and have no guilt whatsoever. RELAX.
I am an elementary music teacher and this book is excellent for a number of reasons. However my only problem, and it is a problem in elementary school when children in grade 1 or 2 want to read the book, is one word. It is another name for donkey and starts with jack. It appears three times and I have taped over the word and put the word donkey, which works well except for one sentence that is suppose to rhyme. The pictures, prose, and included CD are all great and work well in the classroom as well as the home.
I think it is a good guess that most of the money spent making this documentary (or rather series of three documentaries) was spent on the cover graphics, which I must confess caught my eye. This is a great example of deceptive packaging. And let me explain why.First this is not a 12 hour series on Hitler as advertised.Secondly there is no documentary in this package actually called Hitler: The Unknown Story. The name of the six hour slog contained herein is Hitler: Myths, Anecdotes and Lies... which is a misnomer as well. (It is not listed in IMDb.)There is also a three hour documentary misleadingly labeled "The World at War: From Hitler to Hiroshima", which again once you actually watch the DVD is called "From Hitler to Hiroshima: The World at War". This has nothing to do with the excellent Thames Television series from the 1970's entitled the "World at War" and is just labeled such to confuse the viewer. It is in fact one more tedious run through of the same material.Next there is also a three hour documentary on the U-Boats. This might be worth the couple of dollars shelled out for this thing. (Warning if you pay more than five dollars for this package you're going to have a tough time getting your money's worth.)Finally as to the Hitler documentary, which indeed is nearly six hours long... (And feels every minute of it.) If you've seen a couple of documentaries on Hitler you've seen it all before, except for perhaps 2%. I think approximately 70% of Triumph of the Will was cannibalized from a very poor quality print. And the rest is from predominantly obvious sources. Now I would be willing to forgive even that somewhat if they had any new slant on the subject. Some poor English historian is roped in with less than 6 minutes of talking head time amongst the 6 hours. Supposedly he narrates this whole shebang. But he doesn't. ( I wish he had.) Instead we get a very stilted individual talking with a strange American accent who can't pronounce certain words quite correctly. This could be the "director" Jose Delgado who is the "write and director" (sic).By the way this is from Mill Creek and Octapixx???Here's what this mess really looks like to me: With it's horrifying digital transition effects, it's constant and pointless musical score, it's untranslated Hitler speeches droning on through the background as random sound, it's fuzzy images; it all seems to have been crammed together on someone's old PC in about 1997 from preexisting source material (VHS?), without too much regard to content meshing with image. Yes I did glean a couple of shards I hadn't known about. But that's really no excuse. (Maybe I should do one of these.)This wasn't the untold story. This was truly Hitler: the completely needlessly rehashed story.
Few people would deny Elaine Paige's multiple talents: she has been West End's leading lady for more than 30 years, creating and playing many memorable roles: Evita, Grizabella in `Cats', Florence in `Chess', Reno Sweeney in `Anything goes', Norma Desmond in `Sunset Boulevard', to name just few. Her strong stage presence and good vocals insured her durability in the world of the musical theatre and at the same time she managed to make good pop albums. The fruits of her rich career can be heard in her latest excellent 2-disc compilation released two years ago, `Centre Stage: The very best of Elaine Paige'. After that, Elaine got her own radio show on BBC 2, presenting to the listeners some of the most memorable tunes from the past and present of the musical theatre. After the voting for the best British musicals of all time finished, Elaine decided to record this new album, by selecting the songs from the ones that found their way to the top according to the voters.Since the selection of the musicals in question boasts with the titles like `Oliver!', `West Side Story', `Grease', `Sound of Music', `Evita', `The Phantom of the Opera', `Sunset Boulevard' and many more, this should have been an excellent album. Regrettably, that is not the case.There are several problems one notices after giving it a full listen. One of the major ones is the orchestrations. Each of these musical numbers is given a new and different orchestration than the ones they had within their parent musical. Not necessarily a bad thing by itself, but here some of the numbers are barely recognizable, `Aquarius' from `Hair' being a good example. Not only that, for the most part they are produced in such a self-important manner that Elaine's voice becomes lost and unnoticeable amidst their sound. The effect could have been much bigger on a smaller and a toned down scale in this respect.Elaine's vocals are not on the plus side on this album either. She delivers this whole set of songs in a totally lackluster manner, sounding predictable and as if doing all this out of pure habit. This is why Elaine's take on these songs leaves you feeling no emotion at all after hearing them. The only exception is a somewhat playful rendition of `I'm gonna wash that man right out of my hair' from `South Pacific'. Unfortunately, one song does not make an album. It's really a shame, since some of these songs, like `You must love me' from the movie version of `Evita' or `Someone else's story' from `Chess', were an opportunity for Elaine to revisit some of the characters she played in the past.This whole CD therefore comes as disappointment from someone who set her standards considerably higher during the past years. For all those who want to experience Elaine Paige at her best, I suggest to get her compilation `Centre Stage: The very best of Elaine Paige'. Alternatively, if you are looking for a new CD from a musical theatre diva, try Patti LuPone's excellent new album `The lady with the torch', also available here at Amazon.
Professor Ralph Abraham, the American chaos theorist, says in an interview somewhere that he is a fan of an almost forgotten English composer named Cyril Scott. Professor Abraham believes that, one day, Cyril Scott will be rediscovered and his music will be acknowledged as comparable to Beethoven's! This stuck in my mind, for ages in fact, as it would any half intelligent being, and so I researched this Cyril Scott guy (I had never heard the name before).So I research this chap online and it turns out that Cyril Scott is indeed an impressive character; he's impressive because, like Ralph Abraham, he is able to comprehend mysteries other than his profession, mysteries like the occult and other thinking outside of the box activities (he was apparently very good at it too). The Initiate is one of Scott's other activities then, that is, its an occult manual disguised as a novel and if the mans music is up there will Beethovens, then, verily, this book should be something special.In the introduction, Scott says the Initiate is not meant as a novel, but a true story disguised as a novel. When original published in the 1920's, Scott didn't put his name on the cover because, being a true story and all, he didn't want people knocking on his door! So I think Scott meant this book to be a kind of Trojan Horse. You expect fiction, but what you really get is an unveiling to a witness to a truth; the truth.The fiction part is the exoteric, if you like, for those who want fiction, and the cleverer readers will find the esoteric message lurking just underneath the skirts of Cyril Scott's' Victorian prose; like the satire lurking underneath the Simpsons (when it was funny).The pupil in the book is Cyril Scott himself and the mysterious guru, who Scott gives the fictional name of Justin Moreward Haig, to hide the mans real identity, is an advanced human being who Scott knew for a few years in London.The real life Moreward Haig gave Cyril Scott permission to write this book, so Scott claims in the preface. Scott also says that ascended masters, like Haig, who, by the way, Scott met whilst wining and dining the upper crust of London society, and who this book is based on, emerge now and again throughout history to help us mortals and this is the opening scene for the first half of the book (I didn't read the second half).Scott and the Master would meet at dinner parties or back-stage at the opera, and they would mingle with the filthy rich of society and discuss pseudo problems that only the very rich can have, and, during these talks, Justin Moreward Haig, being of a man of towering intellect, infinite kindness, commanding presence, and amazing insight into the workings of human nature, would dispense his magic to the spiritual broken people in the room, to put them on the right track, with his worldly wisdom and elevated viewpoint. He's that advanced and in the preface, Cyril Scott even hints that Haig is above the superman (Ubermensch) but more boddhisattvic; this means that he loves the weakest as well as the best. No master that I know of is like that.Cyril Scott also says in the preface that he had a pen and paper in hand to take notes of Justin Moreward Haig's various sayings and insights during many of these conversations and these notes are the dialogue in the book. Wow, I thought, a live recording of a master at large!Image a fellow following Socrates around ancient Athens and writing down what the man said. These notes would be priceless intellectual waters as pure, clean, real for the reader as it was for the people listening to the philosopher in ancient Athens. Who would not want to fall to his knees and gratefully dip his lips in such a rare stream? The Initiate is one such stream.So the initiate is Scott's autobiography disguised as fiction. This is fine and I guess that people will buy this book to have a glimpse of this Moreward Haig character, to see how a true master operates; a master, incidentally, who taught a genius on the calibre of a Beethoven/Scott (you get the picture). This is exciting and I ordered the book at once and I imagine that if you do the research, like I did, then you too will be expecting your mantras to get shaken with a good dose of wisdom that you won't find anywhere else (Amazon are even charging a lot of money for this book too, even though, these days, you can get the classic novels for only a few pence and only fact based books seem to keep their price. The plot thickens then, and so we are supposed to believe that this is indeed fact and I suppose the reason for buying this book is a sort of.. 'in our world we all know who the great-ones are and so the hidden ones will be even more impressive and Cyril Scott, the genius musician, has actually met one of these advanced people and he has written it all down for us',,, sort of logic).Don't get me wrong, if Scott didn't hint that this is a true story, then I would be pleased with this story. Cyril Scott even admits that the characters are badly drawn and a bit one dimensional so as to hide their real identities! However, to me, this means that Scott definitely means that the Initiate is a true story, rather that a clever literature device to wet the appetite of the reader, like what Anne Rice did in her fantastic Lestat books, and so the burden of proof is on Scott himself, rather than on the will-power of the reader, to produce the goods.To unfortunately, hide the identity of this immortal, Justin Moraward Haig ends up being a mist of a character because I couldn't get a concrete fix on the motives or feelings of this elusive fellow, because his identity must be kept secret, remember!So instead of proper narrative, the master just appears on the scene to say a few words and it appears that Cyril Scott reckons that this is enough; that the genius of Justin Moreward Haig's insights will shine through the paper and hit my frontal lobes with oceans of enlightenment. Well it didn't!Its not terrible, its a nicely written book and the ideas are up there with a man who has read many books on Zen Buddhism and studied ideas found in the Theosophical school. There are some excellent Zen passages in this book that really show off Cyril Scott's learning. I imagine that Cyril Scott must have been an interesting man and a true philosopher himself; he seems like a very nice man, very intelligent, and a good humanitarian, like Bertrand Russell, and it would have been interesting to meet such a worldly bloke. Most modern composers are charisma vacuums and so this Cyril Scott guy is interesting. Unfortunately, the ideas in The Initiate are no way the ideas of a master; they really aren't. For example, in one scene, Moreward puts an over domineering upper crust mother straight and shows her how to act with her daughter, who is in love with a poet. Moreward, as Scott affectionately calls him, has some clever things to say to the horrid mother. In another scene, Moreward puts a fat priest straight and tells him the real message of the Bible. In another scene the master is doing some fancy Zen gymnastics, to the astonishment of the audience. These are clever and fine scenes and in a work of fiction they would be fine. Unfortunately, if this is a real life master talking, then I wasn't impressed. I've read this sort of thing before, but much better. What Morward tells the priest is not on the level of Friedrich Nietzsche and the thing he tells the horrid mother is basically 'self help' advice that we see on Oprah every day and the Zen gymnastics is Alan Watts. I love the banjo playing Watts but I doubt that even he would claim to be an immoral master (I must say though that ideas that seemed fresh and startling in the Victorian era will seem very cliche today and so we shouldn't be too hard on Cyril Scott).Apart from the sophomore philosophy, I was also disappointed at the stiff company that the Ubermensch Justin Morward Haig keeps. I myself wouldn't mind this sort of civilized company, but I would imagine an enlightened being, who sees through that veil of ignorance they keep telling us exists, would see the company as a one dimensional aspect of humanity, a hopelessly dreary aspect, but Morward offers zero analysis of the wrecked state of this spoiled British class; no Nietzschean demolishing of idols here please, we're British! It's like Scott, I mean Morward, was born in this world and so he can't see further than his nose and so he puts into the words of the master words only a rich bourgeois fellow could ever think worth uttering! Will self says smarter things than this!Cyril Scott was born in this environment and this is why the words of the master are slightly 'heard it all before'! Cyril Scott wrote them, I reckon, and his music my well be up there with the immortals, but this book isn't! I'm aware that people are raving about this book online and I have probably missed something, so I will try to read the rest soon. Scott wrote two sequels to this and so I suppose it is still worth looking at. There is a possibility that I am impatient and so ill carefully read the second part soon. I would love to know your opinion on these meandering questions?
Dodie Smith deserves to be in the annals of children's books fame - The Hundred and One Dalmatians is a novel every child can identify. The dogs are very similar to children - they call their owners &quot;pets&quot; and believe they shape the behavior of the people around them. Pongo and Perdita also have an extensive network of dog informants (tapped into when they &quot;walk&quot; the owners). This novel also struck me as an excellent introduction into British post-war life for children (I always thought it especially wonderful that the male owner was some type of British tax genius with lots of connections in the government). While Cruella deVille is not quite as scary as the Disney character, children and adults everywhere can appreciate and identify her with people who see animals as only something to provide a service or product for them - not as creatures with emotions and thoughts of their own deserving of life. A wonderful anti-fur demonstration is included in the climax of the novel. All interested readers should be sure to pick up Smith's sequel as well!
I'm officially imppressed!!!!!.I picked this book without knowing really the Legion. The only book I have that contain the LOSH members is Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds. I liked that, even when I had problems identifying the gazillion characters.Anyway... I honestly picked this up because I thought it was a bargain: A more than 400 pages book for $26. I have to had it even when I didn't really knew the team. I heard this saga was good so I gave it a shot. BEST DECITION IN 2010 I'VE MADE!!.Paul Levitz made a fantastic job. A writing way pass it's time. He achieve for the reader to care for every single legionare. The art is also very good. George Perez kind of good. Old school but good. Plus you can see costume and hair style changes. Unique!.The only bad thing I can think of is that indeed the bad guy revelation was supposed to be a GREAT revelation. But this is a minor complaint. Maybe if Darkseid wasn't in the cover I might have not got this.Ahother cool fact is that at the end of the book there's the script for chapter one (writen on a typer-writer machine!!) and some skecteches and variant covers for the book. One of them seems spectacular to me. HAte they didn't use it for this book, but anyway.Again, I got this book because I thought it was quite a bargain. Now that I've got it and read it I FELL LIKE I CHEAT AN ROB SOMETHING VALUABLE!!!.Get this. You'll get more than what you paid!!.
I bought this for my mother who used to wear tiny women's watches that she complained she couldn't read. This watch has very easy to read numbers, and the indiglo backlight brightens up the entire dial when needed.
Robinson's &quot;Red Mars&quot; is a comprehensive and complete book on man's colonization of Mars. It is full of scientific, political and economic consequences of human settlement on Mars, and arguments from both sides are presented in detail through the opposing perspectives of different characters within the book. In addition, the book is full of symbolism, such as the &quot;elevator&quot; that is built, only to be pulled down by the hands of the revolution destroying much of the Martian surface and dispersing humans in a manner that made me think of the Tower of Babel.The story begins on a spaceship of the &quot;first hundred&quot; people that are off to begin life on Mars. All of them are scientists, which of course makes for a less than complete representation of human kind, although full of intellectualism and nutty personalities. The mission is meant to be representative of the world's nationalities, dominated by American and Russian teams. Each group of scientists have their own tasks, whether it is flying the space craft, cultivating food, construction once on Mars, ecologists to study Mars, terraformers, biologists, physicists, and even a psychologist.The 8 month journey to Mars is enough to drive some people crazy, and Maya, the Russian leader thinks that she is hallucinating when she unwittingly spots a man whom she does not know onboard the spacecraft. People develop relationships and hatreds, and their true personalities start to come out after hiding most of their peculiarities from the selection committee to be able to go to Mars.Robinson follows different characters for each part of the book, and this makes it a more interesting and in-depth read, as we get different viewpoints on how the people see Mars and what they want from the planet. Some, like Ann, oppose its terraforming, whilst others, such as Sax, can think of nothing but. Hiroko suddenly disappears with a small group of the first hundred and no-one can find them. John and Frank hit heads about how the planet should be run, and one day John is murdered - a shock to everyone.Politics starts to play an important role as the first hundred decide they will do whatever they want on Mars rather than be controlled by Earth. They are free. Only, they really aren't. Before they know it, waves of immigrants from Earth, sponsored by transnational corporations begin to live on the planet. But Mars is not its own nation and does not have a cohesive political or police structure. Problems quickly rise to a peak and the first hundred realise they are no longer in control.A revolution begins and is chaotic and uncontrollable. Infrastructure collapses as it is sabotaged. Finally, Nadia the engineer, after finding out that her lover Arkady who began the revolution has been killed by it, decides that enough is enough and she blows up Phobos in an attempt to stop Earth and transnational control and interference. The first hundred realise that they will be seen as ringleaders of the revolution and that they must escape - will they be rescued by Hiroko's detachment?The book is so complete and full of facts that it is a must for anyone with a passion for Mars and science. It is also a must for those that would think to colonize Mars in the future - as a guide of how not to do it.A very realistic perspective, well thought out, and a foresight of consequences that gives me goose bumps.
Replacing the cartridge on your Zeno device is extremely simple. If you're truly bothered by your acne as I was, it's definitely worth it.I've always had clear skin, even as a teenager. I'd get the occasional pimple/blemish from time to time but never had "problem skin." Then, in my early 30's, I started to develop cystic acne. It was EVERYWHERE. I was SO embarrassed by it and couldn't even stand to look at myself. I even refused to go out in public without a ton of makeup on to cover the acne (although, of course, you could still see that I had acne underneath my make-up).I was aware that Zeno didn't have a high recommendation for cystic acne, but I was desperate. I kept reading all the positive reviews on it and how it worked wonders for people. I felt it was worth a try. By this point, I DID try everything else - from acne kits to prescription cream my doctor prescribed. NONE of these helped in the slightest.When I discovered that people would go to a salon for a professional facial treatment that was similar to using the Zeno device which cost them hundreds of dollars for one single treatment, I was intrigued. I started looking into salons and found out that some of them DID offer this type of treatment. Now you can do it yourself at home with a device you can use and re-use for a lot less money, so I was ready to give it a try.Zeno DID work for me. It's as simple as that. I did get regular pimple breakouts in addition to cystic acne and it worked on my regular pimples like magic. I did have to use it more often on my cystic acne but it DID work. My face was COVERED with ugly cystic acne. Some were huge and sticking out while others looked "embedded" in my skin. And, as I said, I was also getting regular pimples. My self-confidence was at a rock bottom low. When I realized Zeno was actually eliminating ALL my pimples, some faster than others, I was SOOOO happy. It felt like a dream come true. Just having this product increased my self-esteem immediately.Like I said, it took longer on cystic acne. I'd have to use it a few more times, so it'd take an additional couple of days. But after just one use, it DID at least make it much smaller and less noticeable. And my so-called regular pimples disappeared quickly as promised. Using it on cystic acne does mean it will be more time consuming and cost more as I was going through replacement cartridges quite fast. But it was worth it to me. I was finally out of "hiding" and willing to go out in public again (NOT constantly worrying about how hideous my acne covered face looked while I was talking to someone).It's SO simple to use, doesn't hurt at all and eliminates normal acne fast. When you're treating a face covered with cystic acne, it requires more time. I'd sit with a mirror propped up at a nearby table/desk and use it on my cystic acne while watching a movie or something.A major bonus I was NOT expecting is I don't have ANY acne or blemish scars. The heat must prevent scarring. I still get an occasional pimple now and then, but the ultimate bonus is my cystic acne breakouts STOPPED! After using Zeno for several months, my breakouts began lessening, and then I suddenly stopped getting cystic acne breakouts. Maybe it's a coincidence or maybe I did something else that was "correct" but I honestly can't think of anything else to attribute this to.I believe it was 4 to 5 years ago since I last had a cystic acne breakout. As I said, I'll still get occasional pimples, but after consistently treating my cystic acne with Zeno for about six months, my acne vanished without ANY scarring remaining behind. At my worst time, I was going through replacement cartridges quite quickly on my cystic acne (probably needing a new one at least once a month). But that's because they WORKED.I had been blessed with great, nearly flawless skin for 30 years. Developing my first cystic acne breakout when I was in my early 30's was devastating. And these breakouts were severe. I only wished that I had discovered Zeno sooner. It definitely changed my life. I had NO idea how depressing, stressful, frustrating & embarrassing acne could be until I started getting extreme breakouts (and I was an adult when they started, so I can only imagine how difficult and life altering it is for teenagers to go through the same thing).Of course I HIGHLY recommend this product to ANYONE (teens and adults) who are suffering from ANY type of acne (mild to severe). If it has gotten to the point where your acne is lowering your self-image and making you want to "hide your face" from people, it's definitely worth a try. You can't put a price on confidence OR self-esteem. It wasn't even recommended for my type of acne (much less the severity of it), but it DID work. It made my acne "disappear" and eliminated all my flaws. It also lessened the number of breakouts I'd receive as time went by after using it on a regular basis for a few months and even prevented any scarring or blemish "marks" from forming. It even stopped new breakouts from occuring! Really... What more can you ask for?
This book is a real gem ! To anyone writing a book, wanting to write a book, or considering the possibility, buy this book !Here's why. The author shows you how to find a niche and fill it by writing your book, as well as how to sell and promote your book. In addition, you are walked through the steps of negotiating a book deal, shown all the pitfalls, and given sample contracts to use or modify. Even though this book is not directed to those of us who choose to self-publish, don't be dissuaded. I almost didn't buy the book, since this book doesn't focus on self-publishing. Fortunately I bought it and found that there is a bonanza of information for self-publishing types as well as those who choose to be more traditionally published.In addition,the book is filled with inspiring examples of people who weren't authorities, celebrities, or otherwise newsworthy, and who nonetheless wrote books that sold BIG !!! After reading this book, you are forced to release the mental limitation that only authorities write best selling books, which clearly isn't true. Subject matter, research, discipline, good editing and consistent promotion are apparently the keys to producing a best selling book, with finding a low-density niche within a popular category being most important.And finally, this is a highly enjoyable book to read. The author's style is clean, concise, and frequently entertaining. The book reads quickly, and every chapter is chockful of meaty morsels of invaluable information. I have read quite a few books on the subject of writing and promoting books and I found this to be the one I pick up most often, to read through again.The author has done exactly what he writes, CAN be done. He's turned writing into a profitable enjoyable home-based business, and he generously shares all the advantages and insider tips with his readers. Then he lays out how to get there in easy logical steps.I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever considered writing a book. Whatever your current knowledge level on the subject, this book will add considerably to it.
This is certainly one of the best albums the Albions made. Some may think it a little TOO seventies with it's use of synthesiser and some of it's style,while others will find it an adventurous and totally satisfying musical journey.The many musicians and singers involved (including Graeme Taylor,Ashley Hutchings,Dave Mattacks,Ric Sanders and the wonderful John Tams ) make this a strangely compelling album that seems to hold together as a piece almost despite it's parts.
I purchased this book thinking that it might be an entertaining story in the "fall of civilization" vein, or a realistic look at what happens to "normal" people when order breaks down. Boy was I incorrect...First off the characters in the book are wooden almost one dimensional people, after the first chapter most would realize that these are not people that a normal person could identify with, they are a group of wanna-be soldiers that masquerade as regular people, with their own military structure and code of ethics that really don't seem to be based on the ideals of freedom and justice that the USA was founded on.I could accept that the author had his agenda to push, fine. Myself being a Conservative and a proud gun owner I figured it might be a little ways to the right of what I believe but, whoa. Examples: Linking the Oklahoma City bombing to a government plan to simply scare the American people. The people in the retreat receive via circumventing the law before the "chaos", parts to modify their weapons to fully automatic and it's presented as a good and reasonable thing for someone to do.... right now. Two characters that are introduced via a shootout with state troopers that want to kill (yes kill) them because they didn't have a drivers license when they pull them over. Worst of all the two brothers are held up like champions of the good and just, and of course they are church going Christians.I lost all semblance of connection for any of the characters in the book before I even started to build it. I have to care about what happens to the people in a novel, and when I stopped a ways through the book and asked myself "What would I do if I met these so called "patriots" in a situation like this?", the answer was; Run away, terribly fast.Eventually the only thing you end up caring about is when the real "heroes" show up and kick these people in the teeth, but don't hold your breath because apparently they are what the author considers the ideal template for a good, caring, freedom-loving, citizens. As a safety section worker I'm all for people being able to take care of themselves in a natural disaster or any type of crisis situation, and I would agree that if you turned off the power most people wouldn't know the first thing to do, granted that's pretty sad, but the model that this author presents in this book for people that are prepared and self sufficient is more like small groups of tyrants that would live on little kingdoms accosting anyone who was unfortunate enough to encounter them. The only redeeming thing for these "patriots" is that the people that they are set against in the book are rapists, cannibals, and murders. Honestly I found it insulting as a Christian, a Gun owner and worse as a law abiding citizen.Save your [...] an buy something you could actually use likeWhen All Hell Breaks Loose: Stuff You Need To Survive When Disaster StrikesI wish I had.
As a therapist I run into people with attachment problems all the time. This book can help professionals and other interested people learn how and why the feel, or don't feel, as they do. Dr. Clinton is an excellent writer and makes the subject interesting and useful for both professionals and non-professionals alike. An excellent and not difficult read.
You can't fault this amazing album on it's musical content, which is ferocious and stands the test of time way better than 90% of old-school thrash albums, BUT the 1999 Relativity Records version of the CD is NOT a remaster as stated on it's packaging and in the title on Amazon. I bought it and checked out the tunes in a WAV file editor as well as using the spectrum analyzer function and there is ZERO difference between this edition and the original cd released earlier.
I was very disappointed in this. The noodles had the flavor of cardboard..absolutely no "miso" soup taste at all and I love miso soup. It did have lots of chunks and good things so it looked appealing but no taste. I even checked the date for freshness but that was fine. Unfortunately I don't recommend this one.
The same recording can also be found here:Ensayos, possibly for a better priceThis is an interesting historical document. It's a mono recording (on a Geloso 150) of a quintet rehearsal/intimate concert done at the living room of Dr. Eduardo Lagos in Buenos Aires sometime in late 1960 or early 1961. It represents one of the first documents of the first Piazzolla quintet.Piazzolla (Astor) - bandoneonVardaro (Elvino) - violinGosis (Jaime) - pianoMalvicino (Horacio) - guitarDiaz (Kicho) - bassVasquez (Nelly) - voice (tracks 11 and 12)
Even though I knew I had never read this novel before, I kept encountering passages that made me think I had, indeed, read it before, perhaps because I had read a dozen novels just like it: rich prettyboys are dying of AIDS. Since they know their quality of life is better than ours, they will insist their quality of death is similarly more serious, more important than ours.These young men are rich. The narrator can drop designer names like crazy. Gourmet food is prepared. Glamorous vacations are taken. Divine interior decoration needs more expensive art objects. Classical music is referenced. These are the things that are important to these AIDS patients. Many of the health problems that afflict these characters will be familiar to those of us who have lost dozens (maybe scores) of friends to AIDS. I was particularly hit hard by the suicide-attempt-by-automobile-carbon monoxide, which was the suicide method of the first person I knew to be diagnosed...in 1982.It was difficult to read the week-by-week account of medical diagnoses and treatments, since I went through the exact same thing with so many of my friends. It was like I was reading their time-lapsed obituaries again. There might be froth here and there, but the seriousness overwhelms us each time another health problem is revealed as worse than thought.I can recommend this novel. The prose style is elegant, glittering, and tangy. Epigrams sparkle, though not often enough. My only complaint is that the narrator has a very irritating habit of introducing too many memories along the lines of "I never blah-blah-blahed, except for one or two times when...." He starts too many passages in this exact way. (A proofreader should have caught the frequent typos/errors that deflate the otherwise sophisticated prose.) To borrow the narrator's favorite stylistic quirk, I have never read an AIDS novel this good, except maybe ten or twelve that were better.
When setting up my sewing room and cutting table, I wanted a larger mat than you can usually find. None of the stores sold self-healing mats in sizes larger than 24x36. I wanted 36x48, and I wanted it to be self-healing. I sew apparel as well as make quilts, and I wanted a mat that was large enough to allow me to cut out patterns with my rotary cutter, not just cut pieces for quiltmaking. After much searching I found the Alvin brand online and took a chance by ordering it.I am extremely happy with the quality and performance my mat. It is a little heavier and thicker than the other brands I've seen -- Olfa, Fiskars, and Dritz/Omnigrid, but that is all to the good. I highly recommend this mat to anyone who is looking for a good mat, and especially to those who want one that is larger than the standard.
It should be noted that this 2001 reissue of Hammer'sTHE MUMMY from Warner Home Video has beenremastered. Both color and sound quality are far superiorto the original release of this tape. There is no indicationof this on the box but the tape speaks for itself. The filmhas not looked this good since its original theatrical releaseback in 1959.
Starfleet Command (SFC) is an incredibly deep starship combat game-if you can call it a game. I think of it as more of a simulator, it's so complex. Star Trek nerds will love the many references to Star Trek's realistic technology and those technologies' application to galactic warfare. So I would recommend this game to Star Trek or science fans who like highly technical gameplay...like me! But most games these days are shallow, so new talent beware-this is a SIMULATOR, not a game. Space, the final frontier...
Believe me when I saw the commercials for this film I was like "pass", but when it came out on dvd i saw it on netflix and was surprise how good and funny it was and it didn't look like one of those stupid low budget movies,fired up is simple two guys in high school go to cheerleading camp to hook up with as many girls as possible in what results to lots of jokes and crazy cheerleading and thats about it believe this is still a good movie to watch,you'll have fun with it till the very end.
Peter H. Wood did a thoroughly researched well written history of African-Americans in South Carolina from 1670 to the Stono Rebellion. I am African-American and read this book for the first time in college; it was assigned to me by a terrific professor, (Thomas R. Hietala). I came to that class with my own concept of what slavery was and what it meant; this book totally challenged me to question my perceptions of slavery. I believed the stereotypic view that Africans were brought here and taught skills here and picked cotton and it was all misery and this book and others he assigned showed me how our modern vision of slavery is very shallow.This book focuses on the rice growing region of South Carolina and it shows how slavers concentrated on capturing Africans from the rice coast because of their agricultural knowledge and skills; he shed a light on who these African people were before slavery. It explores how the cash crop in South Carolina came to be rice. How South Carolina was established as a colony of Barbados and the slave owners in South Carolina were formerly working class overseers who worked for the royal owners of Sugar Plantations in Barbados and later became land and slave owners in South Carolina; in both places (Barbados and South Carolina) the populations became Black majorities.It also shows how slavery system in South Carolina evolved for the enslaved from something that was oppressive and informal into something brutal, permanent and hopeless. The evolution of slavery also changed the owners as they became a numerical minority the also became increasingly paranoid, determined to establish brutal absolute authority over the slaves and blinded by their own propaganda.It seems even more astonishing they began to believe that Africans were better off and happy under a system that enslaved them. The most powerful thing Professor Hietala ever said in our class was "Never forget that slaves always wanted ownership of their own bodies and the power to direct their own lives and destinies; nothing was more important."At times I think historians forget this when writing about African-American slaves. Wood understands this and he also shows respect for how enslaved Africans not only yearned for their freedom but how they planned and took risks for their freedom. He explores in depth the complexity and challenges of their struggle in choosing to look at the Stono Rebellion and the events that lead up to this big risk.The story Wood tells begins with the history of these two communities (Barbados overseers who become South Carolina planters and enslaved Africans) continues with the development of the system of slavery in South Carolina and climaxes at the Stono Rebellion. The most fascinating thing about this act of Resistance is how close they came to success. When reading it for the first time I found myself saddened that they did not succeed because their success could have rewritten African-American History by altering the issues that sparked the Civil War and subsequent events; Reconstruction, Jim-Crow and the Civil Rights Movement. In essence their success could have changed my history and had far reaching implications with respect to who I am.I think it is worth reading because of the history it explores and because Wood is an excellent researcher and writer. He not only uncovers the history but he exposes readers to the lives of enslaved Africans in a new way by portraying them as whole human beings who had a life before slavery. He treats with respect their existence and culture in Africa and acknowledges how it (African culture) influenced the economy and agriculture of South Carolina and by inference the South. It is a brilliant well researched and written work, as a student I came to appreciate that brilliant scholars were not always brilliant writers, Wood excels at both. I recommend it highly to any one interested in learning more about African-American history.
I was fortunate enough to catch two screenings of Mary and Max in Singapore. As soon as I popped back to Australia, I picked up two copies of the DVD and one of the Blu-ray.Although made on a small budget (compared to American claymation films/CGI animation) of AUD 6 million, there are plenty of sight gags to keep any audience amused. The story is brilliant in its simplicity (Mary picks a random name out of the US phone book, and it happens to be Max Horrowitz), and shines as we are shown more of Max's history, personality and eccentricities (apparently, being a member of a science fiction club wasn't enough to convince army recruiters to consider Max 'insane' enough to stay out of military service).Phillip Seymour Hoffman shines as a middle-aged Jewish man with Asperger's. A very quiet man, he only speaks twice (in Yiddish). He is able to express himself very eloquently with nothing more than his typewriter (although he frequently suffers from a minuscule attention span).Mary lives with her mother Vera (a kleptomaniac shoplifter), and a father who has one of the most boring jobs in the world (attaching strings to teabags... in a FACTORY!). Her neighbours include the school bully and the stuttering Damien. While the bully (quite likely a future criminal) is very simple and shallow, Damien and the Vietnam veteran turned amputee-agoraphobe certainly aren't.The extras include a brief audition from Young Mary, and a director's commentary track (well worth listening to, and tons of fun). Eric Bana's mini-interview is very elucidating also. I was happy to learn that no minorities were offended (at least according to the commentary). For my part, I only take offense when people (usually religious apologists) trivialise and/or glorify suffering to further their goals of converting people.
I feel priviledged to be among the circle of fans that will be know as donnie's first...In the tradition of talents like D'Angelo, Bilal, Erykah Badu, India Arie, Amel Larrieux, N'Dambi, Yahzarah, Raphael Saadiq, Maxwell, Jill Scott, Julie Dexter and Me'Shell N'degeocello, this is neo-soul(soul music, born of hip-hop culture). And I claim it selfishly. I don't care who else gets it. The boy is bad. And this is a classic.
Zakaria points to a very important issue that sometimes eludes romantic democracy promoters: dictators sometimes come to power in polls! Yet, does he define the phenomenon right? As a political scientist, I used to teach democracy. The basic 'minimalist' definition says, democracy, to put it briefly, is free elections plus concomittant political rights and civil liberty. What he calls 'illiberal democracy' has to be called authoritarianism. If the book is titled 'the rise of authoritarianism' then all the democracy-bashing goes in vain. Yes, elections without rights breed dictators, but this is NOT a democracy.Then, the author brings some questionable examples to justify his case. For some reason, he considers former Kyrgyz president Askar Akaev, ousted in the recent tulip revolution, an example of freely elected authoritarian leader. Not true. He was NEVER freely elected. Akaev was, at some point of his career, an example of enlightened autocrat - that is why West liked him - but then, enlightenment faded.Seemingly most irrefutable example - Boris Yeltsin. But once again, Yeltsin destroyed democratic institutions in 1993 putch - in the name of FREEDOM. He created presidential dictatorship, for example, to push through liberal market reforms - only to have a KGB guy coming afterwards and jailing the oligarchs - and silencing press - and destroying human rights groups - and finally twisting electons...There is one thing I completely agree with Zakaria, though: it is when he emphasizes is the danger of election without freedom - I would say, election without democracy. But then he comes to a conservative, I would call Leo Straussian, and extremely naive, in my belief, solution - enlightened elites guiding ignorant masses. A wishful thinking. Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely. Elites lose any motivation to govern wisely and moreover to promote freedom once they are not accountable by the masses. Moreover, even if it is true that masses can chose illiberal leaders, Zakaria forgets to mention that the first thing they destroy is actually democratic process and free elections. And when they do not? Then the people have a chance to restore their freedom - through elections, once again. That is what happened in Serbia and Ukraine. In the end, if it is not from the people, there will be no democracy - and no freedom.
"Wasted" is a memoir. It is not a psychology textbook or a guide to recovering from eating disorders.Hornbacher tells her own story--no more, no less. She does so in a gripping, urgent matter and is nothing like the boring, one-dimensional goody-two-shoes "Best Little Girl In the World" anorexic stereotype. This seems to bother some readers, but not me. Hornbacher is a memoirist, not a psychiatrist.Just take "Wasted" for what it is--and take Hornbacher for who she is!
One of the great film noirs of all time. Joan Crawford is in her element as the long suffering mother of a rotten child who drips with contempt for her mother's job as a waitress. I could go on about this movie, but everyone who has heard of it or seen it can attest to its story of hard working mother trying her best to please her spoiled daughter to the point of divorcing her husband to ensure her ownership of a restuarant. Then her second marriage to a penniless and money grubbing twerp who thinks nothing of seducing her daughter, and of course exhausting all means including body and soul just to win the affections and respect from her ungrateful, ruthless daughter. My only complaint is what's with the shoddy cardboard cases? Warner Brothers thinks this is a good way to honor their star? Or are they too cheap to fork over the 50 cents for a sturdy, plastic case? All my movies from warner's from excalibur to billy jack to a cheap copy of Gone with the Wind is given the same ho-hum treatment. Shame on them! Mildred Pierce deserved better! Even 1.00 movies get better.
This cd contains two discs... The first one is the Affirmation Disc (13 tracks) which contains all the songs in the regular Affirmation cd.The bonus disc is called the Declaration Disc (11 tracks)... which was recorded live at the Brisbane Entertainment Center during May 20-21 of 2000. It contains all the recorded live versions of the songs from the Affirmation disc, except for &quot;The Animal Song&quot;.However, the Affirmation Disc has a bonus track, which is &quot;The Animal Song (Hex Hector Club Mix)&quot;... The cd also has a CD Rom feature with detailed notes about the Affirmation CD, video clips, pictures, and links to websites.All of the extra features (the bonus cd, bonus track, and CD Rom features) are not a necessity. But is very collectible for the ultimate Savage Garden fan. Enjoy!
Anyone who appreciates the comedic genius of the late, great Rodney Dangerfield should not pass this book up. In his own inimitable way, Rodney recounts his impoverished childhood in Queens, his strained relationship with his parents, his lifelong battle with depression, his failed first marriage, the monumental setbacks he suffered as he struggled to make a career in show business. Sounds pretty depressing, right? Wrong! This book is pure Dangerfield, chock full of hilarious memories of some of the most celebrated entertainers of the day, not to mention the classic one-liners spread throughout these pages - "I told my landlord I wanted to live in a more expensive apartment. He raised my rent," or "With my wife, I don't get no respect. The other night there was a knock on the front door. My wife told me to hide in the closet." Rodney Dangerfield was truly in a class by himself (and I don't mean facing the wall wearing a "dunce" cap). For anyone who enjoys a good laugh, this book is a must. Trust me on this one and enjoy.
Fans should not fear the Wachowski brothers. The Wachowski brothers should fear the fans.Considering how well the Brothers W dealt with the interweaving of complex ideas in the first Matrix movie, I was willing to be optimistic about their ability to adapt one of the most brilliant works of fiction I'd ever read. I am however, thoroughly disappointed. They might as well have put Keanu Reeves in the role of V.The graphic novel is a thought-provoking discourse on freedom, anarchy, and the price we pay for security. It is many-layered, complex, and intelligent - little of this translates to the screen. Entire characters and plotlines are rewritten or ignored in the film version, and important themes are lost entirely.As a standalone piece of work, it might suck less. But for a fan of the graphic novel, the film adaptation is a poor reflection of a work of genius. Do yourself and your brain a favor - read the book!!!!
If it were just the surface tale of the mystery of who killed Katie Marcus it would still be a page-turner. But Dennis Lehane accomplishes so much more. This is a profound story of loyalty, regret, love and betrayal. Lehane invests every character with a wonderful depth and complexity.The story begins with the childhood abduction of Dave, one of a trio of boys whose friendship at first glance is clearly doomed to not survive adulthood. Dave escapes from his abductors but is never the same. He grows into a haunted under-employed man, who nevertheless has a wife and child now whom he loves as best he can. Jimmy becomes a brilliant thief who reforms after he is sent to jail and loses his first wife to cancer. Sean becomes a detective with a broken marriage. When Jimmy's daughter is killed, the three are pulled together once again. All have secrets that Lehane brilliantly hints at and reveals in page-turning pieces. What caused Sean's suspension from the force? What violent secret from his past is Jimmy hiding? What exactly happened to Dave the night Jimmy's daughter Katie died and whose blood was he covered in when he came home? What is Jimmy's connection to Katie's fiance? Therein lies the surface of the tale but it's in the pained hearts of the protagonists where the tale really lies. He lays bear the contents of their souls and while it's not always pretty, it feels heart breakingly true.So many great moments in this book: Jimmy's love for his daughter, how Dave's wife handles her part in events, the relationship Sean has with his father, how his mother keeps saving newspaper clippings for his wife since she simply must be returning to him, every character struggling in his own tormented way to be the best man he can be, the tragedy of thoughts left unexpressed and then the moment passes forever. I wish I had the ability to express how wonderful this book is. This is a must-read even if you aren't a mystery fan.
I suck at most all FPS games and yet can still play this one. The only other two that lived up to that were CoD4 and BioShock - this is far more fun than those, just due to the sheer volume of content and random details in the game.I never got that into the previous versions, but this game is the best.I would prefer if they relied less on timed missions, where you need to chase someone through the streets and they are much faster than you - but that seems to be this genre.
I bought this switch from Amazon over three years ago and installed it in my attic. The switch is a little loud due to the cooling fans on it but since it's in the attic now it doesn't matter. I'm sure my attic gets well over 100+ degrees but the switch seems to handle just fine. The specs say it's good up to 70 degrees Celsius. It's fairly low powered. (11.75 watt) If done right you could have yourself a nice little 10/100 network with a gigabit backbone.
This cd only has one problem. It's missing Two Hearts Beat as One. Other then that it's a typical best of thats perfect for those who loved U2 in the 80's and didn't want to get all of the albums. Yes, some of the songs run together kind of odd, yes, it's missing a few songs from the older albums but you have to remember it's a best of. Their most popular songs came from Joshua Tree and Rattle and hum so of course those were going to be the high points here. Theres been best of compilations that I have had that totally ignored the first two albums. This isn't a shock at all.This album opens up with a great song and closes with a great song. From there it leaves the door open for a part two to the best of. I'm sure there will be a 90-00 album, but when?The problem is I haven't been a huge fan of U2's 90's material. Achtung was brillant and then after that I lost interest. This best of showed the band in their prime and they seemed like their hearts and their lyrics were all one. Boy and October were great albums, War was brillant, and Joshua Tree was excellent.I'm really shocked at this best of. Most of them are missing two or more songs that I would think should be there. This one is only missing one song. Don't get me wrong, U2 has quite a few great songs that don't appear on this album. But the songs on this cd were the ones I always heard on the radio as a kid.Get this disc. Enjoy it. Play it. Remember when music was great and wasn't as shallow as it is today. U2's music not only moved me but it always made me put some thought into what was being said.
I am currently getting my masters degree in marriage and family therapy and I must say that this is my favorite book so far after one year into my course. While I do agree that the chapters on cybernetics are a little confusing.... To say the least, the chapters on the actual theories explain things with exact precision. I use it as my main reference book and its quickly getting covered with highlighters. Many people are saying this book is too hard for introductory courses and it probably is. However, don't let their negative comments that revolve around introductory courses turn you off.... there is more to life than introductory courses!!! That being said, I think that a person with little knowledge in the field could get a lot of information out of this book if they read slowly and take it one theory at a time.
Go back and do it all again knowing the mistakes to avoid and the opportunities to take advantage of, sounds great right? Jeff Winston thinks so and uses his knowledge of future events to greatly improve on his former life. But, despite all his precautions, he dies again on the same day at the same time as before...only to awaken in his 18 year old body again. All his gains, financial and personal, erased. A blessing or a curse?Who hasn't entertained the fantasy of reliving their life? &quot;If I knew then what I know now...&quot;. REPLAY tells you to be careful what you wish for. Grimwood's tale is very original and thought provoking. Yes some story lines seem to go nowhere but it didn't stop me from enjoying this story nor it will it stop me from reccommending it to others.
I received this set after registering for it. Everything together in one little pack was appealing to me--it seemed more economical to purchase the items included this way and the case great for travel and keeping track of the stuff. And I was right--it's been nice. The nail clippers are perfect and the brush is very soft. I tried using the emery boards, but have found all baby emery boards to be useless. We haven't used the comb or toothbrush yet, but when we do need them, I know where they are!
I wanted this for my wife so she could have a small light on her key chain.This light, when you can get it to work is bright enough. However, this is not a simple 'button' press light. There is a small switch that you must slid, in most cases with your finger nail, up and down to engage the light. In the pictures and even in the description it says, &#34;Constant or Momentary ON/OFF switch.&#34; This is deceiving as well as the picture. Also, the plastic is separating around the bulb. Reviews here of 'solid' construction are inaccurate. The only thing that works is the carabiner clip which is really hard to mess up.I returned one as I thought it was just a flawed item I had received - the replacement was exactly the same so buyer beware - can't believe Smith $ Wesson put their name on this!
I have read many Dean Koontz books...and this one is certainly the least enjoyed. The book started out good...in fact it was interesting for the first 1/2 to ALMOST 2/3rds...but I grew tired of the story line. The ending was confusing...and the plot and presentation...simply did not seem typical of Dean Koontz. If you want to start reading Dean Koontz...please do not read this one... If I had read this one first...I probably would never read anything more from Dean. This book was tough to get through....And I read about 50 books a year. Feel free to send me an email to respond to comment if you would like. I just didn't understand who the girl was at the end of the book-named Nina...but it wasn't his Nina.
My 5-year-old daughter is allergic to every artificial food color so it is difficult to find treats that are tasty and dye-free. This licorice has an excellent natural strawberry flavor. The pieces are a smaller size, which is nice for a child's portion. My only negative is that the texture is a little harder than what you've come to expect with your non-organic full-of-dye licorice, but I found myself gladly chewing a little longer for the wonderful flavor. Besides, it's not a bad thing to have to take a little longer to eat a piece of candy! I'm back to try the raspberry next.
This is quite a time-capsule of a collection. Imagine its 1947, and this new medium is developed and ready to go. On the downside, how will this new medium of television be used? This Howdy-Doody collection shows the developing television medium, especially for children's shows. It is also a trip back to an era of children's entertainment, pre-pc. The innocence and energy are quite refreshing.While the collection is interesting, there is no guide to the main episodes. The episodes included are described as the "most requested" by fans, however, there are no transmission dates (aside from the anniversary episodes on the last disc). One can estimate ballpark years for the episodes, based on quality and sponsors.The developing marketing strategies are fun to see-- by today's standards, the commercials are blatent, and getting the kids to sing the jingles is entertaining. Actually, the kids' enthusiasm for singing everything is wonderful to see.The 'indian' fixation of the show, while dated, isn't quite as bad as I was expecting. The silly broken english used in the characters' lines is ridiculous, but the characters are certainly portrayed as humans, good and bad, like all the show's characters (even if they start 'bad,' or go 'bad,' everyone ends up being friends). By the last episode (broadcast in color, with an amusing early bluescreen shot), this theme seems to have faded somewhat. Taken in context of the late '40s and early '50s, when most of these episodes were done, Westerns were quite big. At least the 'indians' were portrayed in a more positive light than the movies. The marionettes are fairly well done, a bit simple, but no one expected reality back in the day, and they are entertaining.The early episodes appear more like a broadcast radio show than say, a local tv childrens' show in the late '60s or '70s. This adds to the charm. Anyone old enough to have participated in a local childrens' show (such as WOC's Cap'n Ernie's Showboat, for instance) will enjoy this trip back to a earlier era.I'm still not a huge fan of Howdy-Doody, but its a show I'll let my child watch (we do not have cable/satellite, and old tvs).
...when you're gearing up for suicide. This whole album sounds like the last thoughts and comments of a person who's going to just end it all. I found myself suffering nightmares, fatigue, misery and paranoia. My ears unclogged but I started getting headaches and a fuzzy feel in my head. This is not a good album for the stressed, because it will just make you feel worse. I find this album unlikable and mostly unenjoyable. When I first listened to it it sounded inaccessable, after listening to it more and more I started to get more "into" it, but I can't say I found it a good place to be in. It's a somewhat interesting album, but it mostly just dragged me down, made me nervous, numb and hurt my head.People say this is great music. Let them say what they want. Give me some old fashioned enjoyable music that doesn't make a pest of itself. Kid A is just ok to me, and hasn't been worth all the effort to "get into". This almost seems like a sadomasochistic album to spank the listeners. I don't know, maybe I'm missing something, but to hear some "weird" music like this that has miles more heart and is alot kinder to the ears, try "Passengers" by U2.And Thom York sings like a Muppet on this album. By the way I've enjoyed Radiohead's first three albums quite a bit (including Pablo Honey -- why are people always busting its chops).
Ever browse a bookstore and come across a book being marketed as a classic -- except that you've never heard of it? That, for me, is Stoner, by John Williams. Stoner is the last name of the main character, whose life we follow from the time he leaves his small farm household as a youth to attend college.This is a beautifully written story, following Stoner's life as he discovers a love of language and literature, and a love of place at the University of Missouri, where he begins his career.Along the way, Stoner marries and finds love (in that order), enters into friendships and prickly professional rivalries, and seems at times to move through his life with a frustrating lack of insight. This frustrated me to no end as I read: I found myself urging Stoner on to more decisiveness, more backbone, more grabbing of happiness when it was within reach. Yet, I am left with the nagging suspicion that the Stoner we see in this book is more realistic than the Stoner I wanted to see. After all, we all do the best we can without the benefit of hindsight. We aren't guided by an omniscient narrator who can help us think through our next steps. If and when we find happiness, we have to savor it among our various missteps and regrets. Not that we can't be happy or lead happy lives -- it's just that our happiness always has a context.And so it was that, finishing Stoner, I initially felt pretty low, sad for Stoner and his life full of missed opportunities and damaged relationships. That is, until I read an excerpt from an interview with the author, who himself asserted that Stoner "had a very good life.""You never know the results of what you do," continued Williams. "You've got to keep the faith." And this is just what our protagonist Stoner does. Looking back at this book in light of the author's statements, there is indeed a faint glimmer of salvation for all of us as we take our tentative steps, and missteps, through our lives.
This movie reminds me a lot of "Nightmare on Elm Street" and the old movie "Dreamscape" I saw as a child. The killer appears in people's dreams and menaces them with very sharp knives. The dream sequences are pretty darn intense. As with all Tsukamoto's movies, "Nightmare Detective" is extremely imaginative and dares you to think. May be a bit too Eastern for some viewers here in the States. If you are a big fan of other Asian horror films, I think you will like this a lot. I did.
First of all, let me just say that this movie can not be horror. It just can't. How can mutanat killer snowman be scary. I have no idea, and I also think the director had no idea either. Like one reviewer said already, this movie is like an 8th grade video project.This movie starts off when a stupid retard janitor with a dumb hat walks into this lab and starts to clean it when...... are you ready..........are you sure.......ok here it is.....all of a sudden he knocks over some anti freeze collant stuff into this open container. It then goes into this crappy special effect where it zooms in and shows him being transformed into the killer snowman. At this point I, with my two other friends started bursting out laughing. At this point I knew that this movie would be very bad, but in a good, funny way.I don't know why this got an R rating, it wasn't very gory. There was this one scene where Jack pulls out someones eyes, but they looked like white gumballs with ketchup on them. And Jack frosts' costume looks like the ones people wear at Disney World. But whatever. This can not be taken as a horror movie, and I don't know what they were thinking to ever even make this movie. Go rent this movie if you want to see some bad special effects( if you can even call them effects ) and poor acting. The only reason I give this 5 stars is because it was hilarious, and I still can't belive this movie even got made.
What's it about?A 2D animated spin on the origins of Batman and Gordon (before he became Commissioner Gordon), and how their lives come to intertwine.Is it any good?Do we really need another Batman origin tale? I think just about everyone knows the origins of Batman (murdered parents, wealthy entrepreneur etc.), but what makes this movie really appealing and unique is that it follows Gordon's origin. The story is based on Frank Miller's hugely popular graphic novel of the same name, and it really does an amazing job of developing the complexity of Gordon's character. It mustn't be easy for a man to move his life to Gotham City, survive police brutality, become a first time dad, the temptation of having a hot young blonde as a colleague, and chasing down a masked vigilante, all in the space of a paltry 60 minute run time. The voice acting is admirable and the dark toned animation really lends itself to the story, making this film worth watching.Best bit?Gordon races to save his family, with a little help from the caped crusader.Did you know?Batman: Year One was almost adapted as a live-action film to be directed by Darren Aronofsky from a screenplay by Frank Miller. Warner Bros. canned the project in favor of Christopher Nolan.
I like pirate stories and this one was so so. Not really a pirate story but a good basic romance story. Someone mentioned My Fair Lady and I guess that would fit. Good characters. Good descriptive writing. I liked Cliff's family a lot. Not to much sex but enough. I guess this is from a series but I have not read any of the other books. I did like the authors writing well enough. Just a good romance that I would recommend you to try.
Just bought them and tried them with my portable and non-portable devices and they are very soft, particularly in contrast to the phones I already own (i.e., Koss Portapro). Based on my comparison test, these are extremely low-volume headphones that require you to turn up the volume on your devices and when you do, there's no bass. Incredibly, for huge cups over the ears, as far as surrounding noise seeping in, it's as if you have on no headphones at all. These headphones look great but the looks are deceiving. Sony's just not as reliable for quality as it used to be. They are very inexpensive but as cheaply made as the price indicates. Guess you get what you pay for with these. If you think the price is too good to be true, that's because it is. BTW, I'd give them 2 stars but I'm trying to lower the mean-rating of 3.5 stars.
I know this film came out almost five years ago, but I just watched it again last weekend and I can't resist logging onto Amazon and telling you how inspiring this story is.I'll skip talking about what a great actor Russel is (and he truly is) and jump right to the heart of the story. Ridley Scott has created for us a tale of a man who was born to be a warrior but who at heart is a gentle, sad, kind hearted man who wants nothing more in life then to honor his wife and son, and the depths to which he searches his soul to reach that goal left me more aware of my own place in life and how I must strive harder to lead a more fulfilling existence.I don't see this as an action film. Okay, I know that it IS of course, an action film, but to be honest the fight scenes are few and far between. Yes, there is some blood and gore. No, it is not excessive. Yes, people die. No, it is not glamorized.The real story takes place out of the Coliseum and comes to life in the dialog: Maximus (Crow) with his soldiers and fellow gladiators, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) with his sister, Commodus with the Senators, Maximus with the child Lucious. The dialog is remarkably well written, and the acting is stunning. THIS is where the real story takes place.And to punch-down what was already a timeless masterpiece, the cinematography, the special effects and the music are humbling in their perfection. Normally these are aspects of a movie I don't pickup on until the second or third time watching it, but in Gladiator ever element is so rich and beautiful that you can't help but be impressed with all of it from the very first time you watch it.This film is not for everyone. Despite how inspiring it is I don't think I would like my own son watch it until he is well, well into his teenage years. But when he's ready, we will certainly enjoy it together.
for those of us who've followed Barry Manilow throughout his varied career, HERE AT THE MAYFLOWER is a homecoming in every sense of the word. This is barry's first original album in ten years, and it was definitely worth waiting for. Each song is a peek behind the door of one of the residents of a fictional apartment complex called The Mayflower. The musical styles on this album are as varied as the residents themselves--from wistful ballads such as BORDER TRAIN and SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MINE to the humorous and upbeat COME MONDAY and FREDDIE SAID, to the broadway-like NO ONE IS WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE and I MISS YOU, HERE AT THE MAYFLOWER offers something for everyone. and through it all, Barry showcases his stellar songwriting with a voice which is as fine and clear today as it was thirty years ago. I greatly enjoyed the retrospective and tribute albums he's put out in the last ten years, but this is barry at his best!!!
This is a favorite toy that has stood the test of time. Although it's simple - it teaches so many things - colors, stacking, sizing - and children can practice fine motor skills while problem-solving. You can't go wrong with this old favorite!
The big miss here is nothing from album II. Album II features some great tracks, but most of all it is important because of the production work of Robert Fripp, making it a landmark album in Gabriels' musical journey, begining to shape the sound of things to come. "On The Air", "DIY", would have made HIT an excelent overview of Gabriel's musical journey.
Yanni has been quiet for a while but I was so happy to see this concert. Great new songs as well new renditions of some of the old ones. Another classic...
Six year old grand kids loved this book. They look for it now when they come over because they can successfully draw familiar cartoon characters, then detail the costumes and situations as they choose. I was inspired by a visit to the Charles Schultz Museum in Santa Rosa. Schultz drew the Peanuts cartoon strip, and I noticed he had an entire collection of these types of drawing books in his library. Step-by-step methods teach kids to think ahead and give them a feeling of success. It's the same way we learned to read, through imitation of successful models.
Sam Brown it's one of the most talented singers (really) i've EVER listened in my life. I knew nothing about her until I started to listen to progressive rock (Big fan now) and watched the PULSE video (P. Floyd). And she totally rocked my world. Her voice solo in "The Great Gig In The Sky" brought me to tears so...I started to look for her all over the web. I finally I bought this AMAZING record and I confirmed all my doubts. She is a great musician and an even greater singer. If you've reached here and spent loads of time in finding about her, then buy this record. You won't be dissapointed. Guarantied.A ...Hope I was helpful, bye
This beautiful thong is great for curves. The details, especially the way it curves in the back are amazing. Goes great with the matching bra.
I have done a lot of reading on Belfast and the IRA during my work on a novel about a musician who grows up in Belfast and moves to Minnesota. During the course of my own writing I have had many many questions about what his childhood would be like and if I am being realistic in my portrayal of this character. This book was an excellent resource for me, and based on the information in it, I have made some revisions to my character.Belfast Diary gives the reader not only a &quot;factual&quot; picture of life in the war-torn city, but also evokes the spirit of the place. Many times, as I read, I found myself with tears in my eyes at the extreme conditions Belfast natives accept as &quot;normal.&quot;Conroy lived with Catholics in a Catholic neighbourhood as he wrote this book, so I have to admit it has a republican slant to it. I admire Conroy for putting himself into the poorest parts of the city and experiencing life there for himself. This is an excellent book.
I enjoyed this move. I thought it had character and realism. That said, I think it is wrong to call it a comedy. It is a fairly hard hitting movie that has very graphic violence and a gritty taste. The comedy is almost all based on tragedy.I don't recommend it for folks that aren't ready for movie that is rated R based on violence and needs to be.Good movie, but don't be fooled by characterizations you may read.
Buy this series if you liked walking with the dinosaurs. Filmed in great locations and the CGI is actually pretty impressive, much better than the later BBC shows.
The Republican "talking heads" have become some of the most repulsive creatures in American politics, no less than Michael Moore. Coulter and the Neocons have gutted and dismantled the party of Ronald Reagan- while claiming to be its legitimate heirs.Not true.If you want to read a REAL conservative book, check out WHERE THE RIGHT WENT WRONG by Pat Buchanan. It will help you understand why the Repubs are doomed.
I'm so tired of everyone looking for Shakespearian perfection in every film, bottom line, it's a dumb comedy, so turn your pompous search for meaningful dialogue and great script-writingoff and enjoy the laughs. It's a comedy, not Macbeth. I kept hearing how horrible it was, well guess what, surprise, surprisethe critics were wrong again! If you enjoyed the first film, you'll love the second, it was every bit as funny, if not funnier. I don't laugh easy either, but it had me rolling most of the film, in tears laughing at times. I know when to be critical and when to put the brain on pause and just enjoy a good old fashioned laugh. It has that Farelly Brothers-type gross out humor, if you enjoy that sort of thing which I do, then you'll enjoy this. If not, go rent 'Annie Hall,' and spend needless hours pining over the film's lighting and set direction, you know, 'the important things in film'...rolls eyes.
Fernando Ortega is one of the best artist around. Really like his music. It is trully of the Lord. Everything I have heard of his has been first class. I will be buying more of his music for sure. I had heard a song of his on KHCB 92.5 and knew it would be good. Fernando Ortega is blessed person to have a voice like his, I think the Lord is lifted up and praised with his music.
I listened to "I, Mordred" as a recorded book (read by Steven Crossley). I checked it out of the library not expecting much -- how could someone write a sympathetic "autobiography" of Mordred, the man who destroyed Camelot? But it was actually very engaging and plausible, within its fantasy history. And Crossley's reading was excellent.Warning: possible spoilers ahead for those who like to discover a book's characters for themselves through reading.As one who enjoyed T.H. White's classic Arthurian novel "The Once and Future King," I found it interesting to read a completely different take on the characters. Arthur is so noble he's almost a figurehead here. Guinevere and Lancelot barely appear as characters at all (the main story ends without telling its well-known conclusion in detail). Merlin the wise advisor is extremely unsympathetic if not evil, and Nyneve (sp), the sorceress who enchants and imprisons him, is good. (There's a little feminist thread running through the novel as well.) Gawaine is coarser and bloodier than in TOaFK, and Gareth is essentially a carbon copy of his brother, a complete departure from the beautiful, gentle Gareth in TOaFK. Pellinore, who was an amiable clown in TOaFK, is a loathesome brute in "I, Mordred."The story covers only the first two years of Mordred's time at Camelot, and the device that is used to explain how this sensitive young man came to be capable once and for all of such calcutated evil is a little (but just a little) weak. But all in all this was a compelling book to listen to and it succeeded well in painting a sympathetic portrait of a man whose good will and best efforts could not change his fate.
I bought this to replace an electric kettle. Obviously the hot water for coffee and tea is ready sooner now since it is boiled and kept hot long before I need it. The vacuum flask design helps conserve some of the heat so it does not have to consume electricity all the time.The main defect I can identify so far is the temperature reading is inaccurate. I use a Fluke infrared thermometer calibrated to within 1% and it gives instant readings. The hottest temperature of the water I've read during the maintenance phase of a 208 setting is 188F. This was coming out the spout. I took readings inside the reservoir also but didn't find it hotter than 187F immediately after opening the lid. The readout displays 212F when boiling and claims a steady state temperature of 208. I am at 4790 feet altitude where water boils at about 203F given typical barometric pressures. The vessel isn't pressurized, so it's certainly not going above 203. Setting it at "208" doesn't maintain anything hotter than 188 (following the initial boiling), and it creates an excessive amount of vapor coming out the vent continually. Obvoiusly some of this is simply a result of my altitude and the laws of physics. I can't blame the product for those things. However, the temperature settings and indications are simply false. I expect them to be correct. As it is, it's not clear whether the device uses some kind of thermostat or just presets. I am forced to use the "195" setting unless I want quite a bit of steam coming out of the vessel continually (it's not a full boil inside but maybe nucleant boiling near the element going on at "208" setting)
I use this for so much more than turning fish. It is wonderful for flipping any large item and serving things like cannoli, manicotti, lasagna, etc. I have purchased more of these as gifts as I found them to be so versatile.
This is an extraordinary cookbook and, at least in the French edition, a book printed on paper so luxurious as to make the volume weigh twice as much as you might think it would. But, to the cooking: these are sumptuous and wonderful recipes and preparations by one of the great contemporary French chefs. The outlook on food and eating does assume that you have ready and easy access to both truffles and caviar. There are extensive photos and text about the Joel Robuchon restaurant, and also about the purveyors and sources of many of the food types. A lovely book in every way, but not a Julia Child hand holder for the beginner or for those unprepared to spend what it takes to use the ingredients called for in the recipes. First rate.
Once you watch this DVD you will never watch it again, because Mr. Williams cross the line to bad taste and unpoliteness.I think he doesn't need that. I wanted music. He doesn't seem natural, and although with a regular voice, he doesn't convince.
These two novels (the author's third and fourth, respectively) make for a pretty good introduction to the strange world of Alain Robbe-Grillet. I tend to think of his books as post-modern detective stories, in which the mystery to be solved is nothing less than existence itself; that the reader often finds himself in the dark is very much to the point. They should be interesting to anyone looking for an off-the-beaten-path read.&quot;Jealousy&quot; (the better of the two) deals with a love triangle in a remote African plantation... which may or may not be all in the narrator's mind. It's creepy and enigmatic. &quot;In the Labyrinth&quot; is a vaguely Kafkaesque tale about a soldier attempting to deliver a mysterious package in a vast, unnamed city. Admittedly, Robbe-Grillet is not the most approachable of authors, but these densely composed novels amply pay off the attention required to read them.
This was one of those albums that opened my ears and my eyes and made me see the way hehe. I was tearing through a stack of vinyl at some old record shop and there it was. I played it non-stop for days. Well my record player broke but thats when I got it on cd.Romeo's Distress, Dream for Mother, Figurative Theatre, etc, their all classics. The band was so young yet so talented. Theres so much energy on this album it's incredible. Even if you're not a fan of death rock you should still have this in your collection. It's a album that made a huge impact on so many musicians.Now Hanson is probably about the same age as Christian Death was at the time of this album. So theres no exuses to why Hanson is so untalented :).
This is a great 5-part (50 min per episode) program about ancient Egypt. One star is deducted because Kultur authored the programs in non-anamorphic widescreen. If you no longer use a 4:3 TV, you get to watch a postage-stamp sized picture on your widescreen TV (black bars on top and larger black bars on the sides). Hell, the picture is even smaller than you would see when watching a standard 4:3 program on a widescreen TV. I would ramp my review up to 5 stars if Kultur would remaster this title! Don't be fooled by the 16:9 widescreen format listed on the back--unless, of course, you're still watching on a 4:3 TV!
First of all, I would like to say that I came late to the Frasier game. I started watching it after syndication. What always impressed me about Frasier is that the show seemed to have hit the ground running. Most TV shows need to warm up in the first season before they get really good, but Frasier was excellent from the very first episode. I was rarely able to catch the show during its normal time slot and when it wasn't being shown on the other channels as much, I stopped watching.However, I was able to get a hold of Seasons 1 - 3 on DVD and fell in love with the show again. And I have now seen the shows of this final season (which I never saw when they first aired). The shows of this season were great and I found myself cracking up like I did when watching the older episodes. Episodes that stood out for me were "Murder Most Maris", "High Holidays", "Boo!", "The Doctor is Out", "Maris Returns", "No Sex Please, We're Skittish", and "Caught in the Act". However, I found something was lacking here that I had seen in the earlier episodes. I can't put my finger on it, but it seemed that the show had fallen into a rut. You could tell that there are only so many ideas that TV writers could come up with. It was a wise move to end the series now before it got stale and unwatchable. I'm sure many probably think that the show by season 11 was already unwatchable, but I disagree.In my opinion, Season 11 is definitely not Frasier's best, but it's pretty darn good and it provides excellent closure for all of the characters. It's definitely a season that every Frasier fan should see and own. However, I am more anxious for Seasons 4 - 7 to be released. I'm rather mystified by Paramount's decision to release the final season now and keep us waiting for older shows that many consider to be better than more recent episodes.And for those you who don't already know, Paramount will be releasing the other season at an accelerated pace with Season 4 being released in early 2005. So, be patient, it will be here before you know. However, I think season 11 is entertaining enough to pass the time until that happens. But, I can't help but feel that Seasons 1 - 3 are a bit better.
This great little gun has been much used for all sort of my projects fr over 10 years. It is a knock-off China copy of an excellent design.If you want the fantastic quality and perfection of a Binks, then you will still probably want to buy a Binks. In my case, I have used several of these guns for everything from automotive painting to spraying Varithane on wood products (I use a specific gun for a specific type of paint, they are so inexpensive, this is very reasonable to do.) Do not try to mix - use a gun for each type of material used.They are, simply put, throw-away type of guns. Eventually, the seals, gaskets, etc get all leaky and it dies. It is not worth fixing by that time (several years if cared for well) and it is time to replace it. This gun will give you a lot of great service if cared for reasonably, and assembled correctly........it has very few parts: it is a small size gun for small jobs where a HVLP type of gun is not warranted or needed. My last one, I used for over 10 years.... and at this price, that is less than $10 per year. This is why I give it 5 stars.... if you buy it for the right use and purpose, you will NOT be sorry you bought it. If it dies in 3 years, you got your money out of it even then. How can you lose with the Amazon customer service if you accidentaly got a dud... that is not likely anyway.Enjoy!
Frankly when I decided to finally breakdown and get a DVD burner, I looked a long time before deciding on this drive. I wanted a product that I wasn't going to have to fight with to get it in my PC and worked as advertised. Unfortunately you never know how something is going to work until you've plunked down your hard-earned coin, gone through all the hassle of taking your case apart, fitting everything back in, putting it together, and only after firing it up do you actually know that maybe it's gonna work - or maybe it won't. Who need's that hassle?When deciding on anything for purchase I really only have two criteria: the reputation of the manufacturer and the opinion of other customers. I freely admit to being a Sony partisan - every appliance I've ever bought from them has been a winner and when I finally do buy something with the Sony logo and it doesn't work flawlessly out of the box, I will weep like a jilted lover. But sooner or later, it's gonna happen - you know it and I know it.So that takes me to the customer ratings: the opinions of fellow consumers who've been there and done that. While the customer satisfaction rating is high, it'd only been rated by 2 or 3 people when I decided to take the plunge. And I'm leery of evaluations by someone who's never evaluated anything before. Maybe I'm just paranoid, but I generally take look to see if the reviewer has a track record and consider that angle as well. So, after all that, I hit on this drive and decided to take a chance. It was a good call.The computer I was working with was only about a year and half old (or middle aged in terms of techno-life span) and I think that's going to impact whether or not you have success with any upgrade. Also, I'm not your average bear when it comes to PC's - I've been in this game since CPM was an actual O/S and a huge hard drive was 10MB and reserved for the military: no one else could afford one. That said, this drive was a dream to install and configure. When installing the drive, check with your PC's manufacturer or documentation, but if your PC has been thrown together in the last two years, use the "cable select" option; for older systems, I'd recommend replacing an existing drive and making this the master drive.Microsoft (love 'em or hate 'em) is the biggest software company in the world for a reason - most of the time their stuff works as advertised. In this case, XP immediately recognized and installed the drive with no more interaction from me than just turning the system on.Having gotten this far (and before doing anything else) go to Sony's website and download the firmware update for this drive. One point: before running the update you're advised to turn off DMA transfer mode, which is done in Windows device manager. It's beyond the scope of this review to give you detailed technical instructions, but using any web search engine will easily walk you through the procedure. Having done that, reboot your computer. When it comes back up, you're ready to install the Nero DVD authoring software that comes bundled with the drive. It sounds like a lot of work, but in reality it only took me about an hour to accomplish all that and start making my own DVD. And it worked flawlessly in my home theater. The sound was the biggest surprise - who knew home movies could sound so good?So I highly recommend this drive. It works great and the Nero software is a breeze to use. But, as Dennis Miller used to say, "that's just my opinion. I could be wrong."
As always, Marquand's thoughtful novels address universal issues in a very personal way. It is interesting to reflect on his 1939 perspective about politics in the United States in view of the world situation today. So many of the observations still fit to a tee. Reading this book is like spending time with old friends, smart ones who help you to understand that there is no going back and that life isn't fair.
I didn't buy the DVD, yet...I love this movie. It's sweeping vistas, it's awesome characters and Charlton Heston is so damn sexy...he oozes testosterone...it's a really great movie, and it has Charlton Heston with his shirt off, did I mention that? Great movie...truly excellent story line, love the excellently creepy Chuck Connors if you're thinking Rifleman, think again. Burl Ives is phenomenal, he always is, I'm a huge Burl Ives fan...and Charlton Heston has his shirt off ...did I mention that? Damn, he was sexy.
this CD is true, from-the-gut pure anger and brooding. It makes music these days look like themes from sappy disnee movies. A MUST-HAVE METAL CD. PERIOD.
Her voice is definitely unique and very recognizable. Her hits "Circle In The Sand" and "I Get Weak" were some of the most memorable songs from the mid to late 80s. An excellent album that should never go out of print, but perhaps looks like it has from what I can tell here. Also, another great rendition of "I Get Weak" (another one of songwriting guru Diane Warren's excellent creations) is performed by rising young artist Jordan McCoy (discovered by P. Diddy), who does "I Get Weak" justice.
that a better pianist would record this beautiful music. It is adequate, but not great CPE Bach and JC Bach's works are difficult to come by and it seems that most top performers don't want to record their workIf anyone hears of a more proficient recording, please comment, thanks
This case is perfect for a small digital camera, such as a Nikon compact (not SLR). Comes with a belt loop and strap. Seems to be well built.
Benjy, the family dog, has been relegated to sleeping outside in a new doghouse that the family has built. But he doesn't want to sleep outside, feels unloved, and sets out exploring into the night. He takes up with a neighborhood baker who feeds him snacks, and gives him a warm place to spend his nights sleeping away from the family. Eventually, the baker has to put him out, but all is well since the faily decides he can sleep in the house again.
I recieved my CD yesterday, I had never heard anything by the artist before and I bought it off a whim. It is an amusing listen, Laurell has a pretty voice and the songs sound like they come from the early 90's pop/rock with a soft floaty tone. &lt;&lt;looking>> It was copyrighted in '86, which I usually wouldn't think about as a way to judge new age artist... but this just really fits the genre in a not to serious way. The songs are cute, floaty, and easy to listen to, even at times to really smile on the inside. There was some really deep catchyness with a few of the songs. Where I felt the album was limited was that of the six tracs (so the album is short as they are regular sized songs)(one is hidden and I haven't been able to listen to it on my walkman) two of them weren't remarkable for me, though the other three were very enjoyable. I don't think that this cd will be among the ones that will get much use in my collection, even though I would probably share one or two songs with others.
This movie was cloying, sentimental, sappy, banal, trite and boring. Tim Burton's movies all look alike. And as an Alabamian, the stereotypes of the south were annoying, and at times offensive. Avoid this turkey.
This is a good, sturdy bath lift. It works smoothly and the battery stays charged for a quite a few days. The bather is always in control of the rate of the lift and descent into the tub. The price on this is excellent. I priced bathtubs with built in lifts and they cost into the thousands. The only caution; If your tub has any kind of patterning or graininess in the base, the suction cups won't work. The suction cups on the bottom of the lift adheres to smooth surface tubs only. On a smooth surface, the suction is very powerful and the lift is very secure. This is a good lift for injured or older people. A paraplegic person can use this. Using it allows for independence in bathing or bathing with very little assistance. The remote is very simple to operate. Set up is very easy...no tools required. Battery needs a 24 hour charge before lift can be used.
I read this book despite the reviews about the enforcement of marital rights, the attitude of the hero, etc. For whatever reason, those things did not bother me.The thing that struck me about this book was the overwhelming stupidity of the heroine. How stupid is she? Let me count the ways. She is so stupid that she is shocked and angry that her husband wants to have sex with her. Come on. No woman in her day and age(or even this one) would expect a man to marry you, provide for you and never,ever plan to sleep with you.For a woman whose mother was a whore and had a roommate who was a whore(who in fact "took care of business" in the same room as Cassie) the heroine was ridiculously naive. The stupid girl even asked herself the idiotic question that finds its way into most bad historical romances "will it fit"? Oh please Cassie, shut your ignorant mouth. The hero had to explain to her the ways of sex. Come on. Given her background, she should have been able to tell him a few things.Let me get back to how stupid she is: stupid enough to trust people she has every reason to fear. Stupid enough to run away, while very pregnant, with no thought as to how she would take care of herself or her baby, endangering them both. To distrust the only person in her life who ever helped her or treated with an ounce of respect-AFTER deciding to start over and build a life together.There is more, but I dont want to beat a stupid horse. So very bad.
I checked the evidence that homeopathy can cure parasitic infestations. There is none. No evidence whatsoever.All this product is, is sugar pills.Don't waste your money.
This is my favorite tv series, but Season 1 is definitely not without its flaws. Certain episodes bore me to tears ("The Green Room", "Higher Education", and "April Is The Cruelest Month" with Chandler. Yes, THAT Chandler) and Brandon has a new love interest in almost every other episode. And he pretty much ran the gamut from a friendless 'poor little rich girl", a teenage single mother, his old sweetheart from minnesota, a supposedly talented tv actress (who was one of the most annoying characters ever), and at the end of the season Andrea Zuckerman (almost). The best episode of the season is "Perfect Mom". When Jackie Taylor shows up to host the mother/daughter fashion show high as a kite is just priceless. Anyway, things only get better from here up until Season 3 so enjoy it while you can.
These earbuds aren't bad at all and really nice for average buds and for the price. I bought em couple years ago and I still use them... because they still work unlike some other ones. Straight 2.0 jacks never works for me cause they always get damages the way I use them but this has L shaped jack and it works perfect for me and the joints and the wire itself is very flexible so they don't break down easily. Only thing I personally didn't like was the the length difference.
What a tearjerker! I cried through most of this book. It was amazingly well written with a host of well-developed characters. I can't say much without giving away key story points, but the quick overview is that it's a love story that will tug at your heartstrings.The only downfall is that there is a lot of religion, which lessons it's appeal to me. I did not expect that to be a central theme. Despite that aspect, it's still a fabulous book.
This game is awesome. I bought it about a week ago, despite the reviews. Well, the reviews were WRONG. The loading time is, if any, 5 seconds. It can be a bit difficult at times, too. Oh, plus, it is mainly a game, NOT the movie, as a few people had said. It's more playing the game than watching the clips from the movie. If you are a fan of Nemo, or underwater games, buy this.
I REALLY wanted to like this movie. I really did. But anyone thats KNOWN a single gang member (I grew up in these neighborhoods, it aint pretty, and it aint even like "COPS"), the typical ones; brain ruined from a lifetime of tragedy, horror, drug abuse, malnutrition, neglect, sociopathic behavior and pure evil... NONE of the characters displayed any of this in the film. Every so-called "thug" was just a "Oh, I'm sad and lonely, but I'm a good kid inside with a tough wall up guarding my feelings" OH SHUT UP. That alone ruined the movie. NONE of what REALLY happened with the real punks this movie is based on is in the movie...read around on the Net after you see this glorified piece of garbage.Oh, and why cant Hollywood make a movie about a WHITE guy trying to save these kids? ESPECIALLY WHEN ITS THE TRUTH? Nope, can only portray Whites as evil perpetrators of 'disadvantaged' youth. fact is, and look it up for yourself, the Coach says that the schools that finally gave him a break only did so after a legal threat, and they assumed since the Coach was white, the players would be too, thinking they had a "White, and less violent" brand of incarcerated youth. The movie twists this around, making everyone involved look like hardcore racists, when that simply isnt true.This movie should be re-done, and the pulp-fiction style of jumping from one story to another should be removed. You never know the characters, or whom the other people are, or WHEN anything happened. They make up fake gang rivalries which simply arent like that at all in real life. Hey, I knew Jerry Walker from Burleigh St in Milwaukee, I know what I'm talking about. Hollywood must have asked a writer for Seinfeld to write this script.At least the end of the DVD shows the real coach, and the messed-up mindset of the REAL kids interviewed at this facility. One kid was obsessed with gaining approval from his mom...two words out of him and you know his mind is messed up. THATS the reality of gang life...a messed up mind and nowhere else to go. THATS why they never leave. The AWFUL acting of these people ridicules the entire story.
I was not impresed with this book. While everything is sorted it is still kind of piled together(small print and crapping newprint paper with no space between anything). I looked up some of my favorite and the recipes were messed up.
Dan Hedaya gives an Oscar worthy performance.
This true story reads just like a novel. It's the story of Sultana, a fiery Princess for the ruling house of Al Sa'ud in Saudi Arabia. Throughout her personal experiences we learn a lot on the status of women in the country regardless of their social rank, and it shows how the culture that they cherish and accept to a certain degree is also one that they hate but have very little power over. This is fascinating and I highly recommend the trilogy to anyone who is interested in women in Saudi Arabia. I also recommend another book "Nine parts of desire" by Geraldine Brooks, which covers the same topic.
I have to say this was an absolutely great book!! I read it straight through! I laughed, cried and got really mad and the heroine! Definitely a keeper and am looking forward to devoring the second book in the Merry Widows series!
This is a real favorite in our house. My son has loved it since he was two and I still sometimes tear up when I read it though it is very genuine and not overly sentimental. The illustrations are flat out gorgeous. The sense of place it creates is very real, perhaps especially for those of us who have experiences loving the land in rural places. The love between the boy, his grandparents, parents, and the love they all demonstrate for the land, plants, and animals around them is inspiring. I also love that it depicts a boy doing fun, interesting things and being loving and nurturing with his family.
Great book for those who love to entertain and cook for others. Their themes are unique but easy to pull off, and I love how they also have crafts ideas on party favors, flower arrangements, decorating ideas, etc. in addition to the recipes. Probably my most favorite entertaining book so far.
Here is a collection of most of Camouflage's best tracks, but with a couple of obvious ommisions. Where are &quot;That Smiling Face&quot; and &quot;Anyone&quot;? Also, a few of the tracks here hardly seem to qualify as their best(&quot;A Picture of Life&quot;, &quot;Strangers Thoughts&quot;, &quot;I Once Had A Dream&quot;). The remix of &quot;Love Is A Shield&quot;, however, is quite good.
Although their sounds are distinct, this album reminded me of Dissection's "Storm of the Light's Bane" on one level. They're both catchy, accessible, and atmospheric, but not commercial. I don't necessarily look for accessibility in black metal. After all, Emperor's rather difficult "In the Nightside Eclipse" is my favorite black metal album. However, it is nice for a change when you can love a black metal album on first listen without putting too much effort into it. This is definitely one of those albums. This may be true for Cradle of Filth, Dimmu Borgir, and their clones, but those bands are only accessible because their music doesn't have as much depth or lasting value as the true black metal elite. [Note: This isn't to say that they are bad. Cradle isn't my taste, but I can stand Dimmu.]Like much of black metal, it is missing the point to describe it on purely musical terms. Like most other black metal classics, it is the atmosphere which makes this album enjoyable. It's not particulary sadistic or sad. It's simply dark and grim. Necro, if you will. If any album conjures up images of the frozen north, it would be this one. It's the perfect album for dark, wintry days.If I were to rank my favorite black metal albums, this probably wouldn't make the top 5, but I'd put it in the bottom half of the top 10. If you're new to Immortal, start here. There isn't a weak track to be found.
Great sdtrk, the music is soaringly romantic and gothic.Gerard Butler sings with beautiful emotion infusing passion where needed (i.e Point of No Return)and allowing his phantom to gain the sympathy of the audience. Emmy sings her parts beautifully with an ethereal, celtic-like quality to her voice. There is this awesome melancholic tone to her voice in Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again that I didn't get from Sarah Brightman in the Original Cast Recording. Patrick Wilson sings handsomely as Raoul. The Broadway actor saves Raoul's seemingly annoying character from being disliked by the crowd. He doesn't sound muffled, wimpy, out-of-date, boring, or stuck-up. His voice sounds crystal clear, young, romantic, and very manly.The music is lush! it's fun, dark, romantic, sexy and tragic.I really feel that it does justice to the musical and is able to stand on it's own.I wholeheartedly recommend it, the only major problem with it is that many people have a problem with Gerard's voice. And while at the beginning I was one of them, I soon noticed something very different between the tenors who otherwise sang the phantom's part and Gerard. Granted that he is no tenor, but the actor sings with this feeling, conveying EMOTION and not just skills. The phantom's supposed to have an angelic, soaring, voice? Well gee, Michael Crawford sure didn't fit that description and still after eons have passed since the musical he gets all the praise. I haven't heard one actor that played the phantom fit the above description; so why should Gerard be bashed on? Infact, he's one of the best phantom's that I've heard and seen and that's overloooking his obvious attractiveness. The other guys may have the voice, but Gerard has the feeling, and that's far more crucial because the story dwells on a man full of passion and pain, and well, Gerard brought it out very nicely!Besides, it's a FANTASY rendition of the phantom tale, not some documentary that has to be precise. Give the man credit for his notable scotsman courage to be able to take on this grand role. Even if you didn't like him, give him the merit he deserves people!
I loved the whole album, her voice is fantastic, the songs are soulful and rockish. I would buy her next cd in a sec. by the way she is in herbie hancock's new cd "possibilities".
I bought this, after trying several other sharpening products. None worked particularly well. This included. It does a barely adequate job of sharpening, inconsistantly and with minor blade scratching. Not a fan.
This is the second Invicta watch I purchased that was defective. In this case, the automatic movement began working (after some initial winding) but I was surprised to see that it had stopped in the middle of the day (while wearing it). I cranked it up and again, it stopped after a couple of hours. This pattern continued to repeat before I finally decided to return it for a refund. Yes, its a nice looking watch (if a common and tired design) and is sold for a great price, but I'm now quite skeptical of Invicta's quality. I had previously purchased the very similar (but smaller) style #8932 from another store and it had the same issues of running for a while, then stopping. Which was even more surprising in that case since it was a battery-powered quartz movement (battery replacement was no help). So I guess if you are one of the lucky ones to get a good unit you have a real bargain - if not, you may be out of luck and late for your appointment!
Let me begin by saying that, if you're a fan of PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, CAT WOMEN OF THE MOON, ROBOT MONSTER and similar awful movies, this pastiche is certainly worth RENTING (but probably not worth purchasing). The dialog is funny in places, and there are a few genuine belly laughs. The generic production music is especially good (though a bit too hi-fi sounding).Unfortunately, THE LOST SKELETON falls rather short as an authentic re-creation of classic low-budget thrillers. The editing is too sophisticated; scenes that should have been presented as tedious medium shots are presented in a series of cross-cut closeups. The dialog (especially the Skeleton's) contains too much contemporary slang to be credible. Character names are obviously corny; no self-respecting director, not even one of modest talent and questionable taste, would ever call a major character &quot;Kro-Bar.&quot; The resulting film plays like a black and white version of ROCKY HORROR: amusing, yes, but you're laughing WITH the cast and crew, not AT it.Genuinely bad movies are inept, but genuinely sincere. LOST SKELETON is just silly, and too clever for its own good. Nice try, but no cigar.Want a REAL laugh? Check out THE CREEPING TERROR, easily the most gawdawful, side-splittingly hilarious example of this wonderful genre. And it's the REAL thing!
I am so tired of people laughing at and making fun of Xanadu! All I have to say is if you cannot see what is so beautiful about this film I am very sorry for you. The concept is exquisite. "Kyra" is one of 9 muses, a daughter of Zeus, and she appears to inspire a disillusioned painter and a musician in the autumn of his life.I can watch the opening sequence "I'm Alive" over and over again! When the mural of the 9 muses comes to life, with each ancient sister encircled in colorful light and they start to dance...Sandahl Bergman looking spectacular!...it still takes my breadth away. Enjoy it. Please. As Kyra says, "come take my hand..."
Installed quickly and easily. Hard to find 3" venting accessories. I do wish the manufacturer had used a crimped end on one side of the connection.
Soulfull baritone crooning enhanced by alchohol and ennui, overlaying a remarkably diverse array of musical styles - all played in a very "Nuggets" primitive garage style fashion. There's slow dirgy laments, surfy spy rock melanges, speedy punk gems, all held together and made cohesive by a constrant stream of delicious, timely guitar and vocal hooks. Though some of the singers lyrics may strike one as a tad trite (lots of maundering over lost love in the tradition of bands like The Cure) his voice is gorgeous and more than makes up for it. Rich, deep, and strained, it perfectly offsets the deliberate distortion of the guitars and the punky roughness of the production. This is a VERY good album, but it doesn't necessarily give the listener anything (s)he hasn't already gotten from their earlier material. If you liked the older records, you'll like this - but don't expect any new ground to be broken - this is totally consistent with everything else the band has done. That said, the Stars are a criminally underappreciated group and this record would serve as a perfect introduction to anyone who has yet to hear them. Fans of stuff like Morphine, the Cure, the Screaming Trees, or even the Buzzcocks would all be well advised to give listen.
A different company could have done better with releasing Dynasty in season sets!There HAS TO BE A WAY to get Paramount to licnese Dynasty to to someone else!What we need to do, is start a petition, getting Dynasty released in complete season sets, at a cheaper price!Please have Paramount give Dynasty to someone else!
First of all, the biographical anecdotes that Bronson presents are great. They are pictures of interesting people who struggle with real issues. These stories are entertaining and well written. With that said, I was disappointed with the suggestions (or lack there of) found in the rest of the book.Bronson writes that, "We all have passions if we choose to see them,". This is certainly true. However, it would seem a book with this title would provide a means by which a person can differentiate their passions. What I mean is, it's impossible to follow all of our passion, and neither doest it seem that we `should' follow all of our passions. I know it would be a major mistake for me to follow some of my passions. So, how can a person know which passions to follow? I wish Bronson had spent some time on this instead of merely pointing out that passions exist in all of us - by this he almost takes an `it's all good' attitude.Bronson writes about `callings', but doesn't explore where these callings come from. Additionally, he strangely writes about self-acceptance. He doesn't seem to acknowledge that there are some things about ourselves that we should accept and others that we shouldn't. This would be essential in a book like this. Furthermore, he refers to moral guilt as always being negative. He misses the fact that moral guilt is sometimes very good and inhibits us from doing what we should not do.Lastly this book comes across as promoting an essentially self-centered life. You find your dream, and then you go get it for you so that you will be happy. This approach short sells the importance of others, and doing things for other people. That is, altruism can be an incredible source of peace and satisfaction. However, Bronson feeds the "me-first" message that is so strong in our culture today.In short, this book deals with a very important and much needed subject. Unfortunately, the conclusions presented here leave much to be desired. If you want to read his 'bottom line' check out page 362 - the first full paragraph.
This CD is the definition of selling out. Kenny G. has realized that he can make more money playing garbage than he can by making CD's of substance. When I heard the track with Louis Armstrong, I started dry heaving. There are many kids out there who will start playing the sax after hearing Kenny G not knowing about John Coltrane, Dexter Gordon, Lester Young etc.. musicians that influenced Kenny G. If you are interested in learning about Jazz, go out and buy a Dexter Gordon CD. If you want to practice your frizbee throwing technique go out and get &quot;Classics In The Key Of G&quot;,one of the easiest keys to play in by the way
THis book should be titled how Abe Maslow,the father of Humanistic Psychology, became a trading coach. If you agree with the idea of Humanistic psychology that every person has a strong desire to realize his or her full potential and to reach a level of "self-actualization when people experience "peak experiences" those high points in life when the individual is in harmony with himself and his surroundings, then you should get this. I don't see how that works in a trading environment and is a rather simplistic view of psychology in general and so I give a pass. Far Far Better is thePsychology of the Stock Market (Classic Edition)andTrading in the Zone: Master the Market with Confidence, Discipline and a Winning Attitude; two books that will actually help you in your trading. /TKL
A thoroughly enjoyable beginning to a favorite fairy tale!This story reminded me of Tolkien in that the story is deep enough to keep you interested, yet simple enough to allow your own imagination to &quot;flesh out&quot; the story.If you like fast paced stories with lots of combat you'll like it! If you like stories that offer deep insights into people and how we tick you'll like it! If you like variations to familiar stories you'll like it!In the words of Mikey's brother: &quot;Try it, you'll like it.&quot;
I'm reading the first chapter "Ruby in Review" and it is chock full of typos and mis-usages. This is particularly disconcerting pertaining to the very first sample program; e.g. it contains the statement "str.chomp!" but then the the ensuing explanation alternately refers to "chomp" as well as the previously un-discussed "chop". I'm an experienced Perl programmer and know the difference, but this must be confusing to other readers not lucky enough to have such background. Furthermore, referring to the same "chomp!" operation, the exclamation point is referred to as a prefix. This is incorrect: it's a suffix.Computer language interpreters including Ruby itself would balk at such imprecision in code instuctions, and therefore I balk at such imprecision in English. It makes me wary that code samples later in the book will contain typos, though I give the book one star more than the minimum because the first sample program as entered in the book does run properly. Still though the editors should be ashamed.I see this over and over with technical books: the first chapter(s) are flawed with such typos, probably because they get written and reviewed first, several months before the rest of the volume is finished. Further indication of this is the author's comment near the end of the first chapter that he is unaware of other languages with the "===" operator. Perhaps he wrote this for the first edition; by the time he wrote the second edition, particularly with the explosion of Ruby on Rails and Ajax, he should know that Javascript also provides the "===" operator (as does PHP).In addition, the title of this volume is misleading and pretentious. Ruby suffers from the same "there's MORE than one WAY to do it" approach as Perl (e.g. "poetry mode" that dispenses with parentheses around method arguments). Perl has proven this sort of thing is a drawback, not a benefit. It's derisively referred to as a "write-only" language, and I predict Ruby will be considered likewise after 3-5 years when a sufficient base of Ruby code exists such that Ruby "maintenance" programmers will be in demand.Furthermore, the author frequently notes how some of these multiple ways to accomplish things in Ruby can "confuse the parser"; there's no arguing this is a drawback. It can only further slow down a language already slow due to its interpreted, dynamically-typed, object-oriented nature.Tech authors, do yourself a favor, and have somebody (re)edit your initial introductory chapter(s) at the tail end of the process, otherwise risk making a bad first impression. Programmers, do yourself a favor, and don't just blindly jump on the Ruby bandwagon.
It's true that Cold sounds a hell of alot like staind, but the reality is that they are better than staind so nobody cares if they rip them off. This cd is really great and I recommend it.
This movie was a good see in general, bringing the horrors of war on screen in a moving experience. Unfortunately this movie has led to a whole bunch of bad war movie follow-ups, such as windtalkers, tears of the sun, and black hawk doen.
Lovely looking blanket, but the digital control is very tricky and it doesn't heat.Put the blanket on and turned it on, first on 3 as a warm up. No noticeable heat. Tried to turn it up but the "E" appeared on the controller. After unplugging and resetting I set the controller to "H". There was almost some heat after an hour, certainly nothing like a Sunbeam will put out.I bought this blanket 2 years ago as a back-up to the Sunbeam I had, since like others I have had Sunbeams last only a year and usually quit on the coldest night in January. However the trusty Sunbeam is still going, perhaps not strong. but certainly a lot warmer than this worthless Biddeford blanket.
Just didn't work. Wouldn't work with several devices. Deader than Abraham Lincoln. Not worth a huge hassle of exchange. Kingston memory quality varies. It's a roll of the dice.
UPDATE: After I wrote this review I started having problems. The player would lock up [you know--like Windows!] Requiring me to remove the battery to get a reboot. It also started having problems synchronizing with the computer. It finally froze permanently, but my then was not returnable. I just threw the darn thing out. I have since purchased a Sansa E-280. This is a flash player, rather than a hard drive, is smaller better looking has a bigger screen displays album art, plays video and has a micro SD slot to expand memory. It also costs about thirty bucks less. If I could change my rating on this player, it would be one star.Wonderful sound quality 8 GB of storage holds photos, can be used to transfer files, has FM radio. Ear buds didn't fit my ears. 10 colors available, though not all are at amazon. If they don't have the color you want here, go to the mfr's site, creative.com. The price on this is the same everywhere. I do wish the rest of the case, besides the front were black instead of white. It looks too institutional in white. The battery is good for 10 to 12 hours and can be swapped out. Get your spare here. Amazon partner eforcity has it for under 20 bucks. Regular price is 40.
This is a surprisingly good album of hi-nrg disco-pop that only got released in Japan, but it deserved better than that. Burns & Coy have the chops to craft a decent pop tune and these don't disappoint. "Unhappy Birthday" features an uncredited Billy [Ultravox] Currie on electric violin. Hardly lo-rent gay disco fodder! Laugh if you will, but I think Pete Burns is concerned with releasing quality music that can exist outside of a club floor. At least on this recording.
Actually, let me say up front that this flick is more like 3 stars if that, but when I feel a movie is unjustly dumped on, I like to give it a helping hand. Having previously read the reviews here I passed it up, but, while browsing a used DVD store, I came across it and figured it'd be worth $4. Now, I suppose this is the part where I say, "boy, and am I glad I did!" but, honestly, it wasn't that good. However, it wasn't as bad as some reviewers here make it out to be. Upon finishing this movie, I suspected some sort of agenda-mongering by some of the reviewers here, but upon revisiting this page, I think the truth is that many of these people are simply jaded.First, the cast is pretty decent. Contrary to what some have said here, they all performed quite well. The characters were likeable (unlike in some films) and the actors made you care about them (at least, should you make a modicum of an attempt to suspend disbelief in a film about rampaging sea-monsters). Many were unknowns, but that didn't make them "amateurish". I guess there's an element out there that figures if they aren't "name" actors, they must not be good. The entire cast did a good job being half-way convincing as oil-rig workers. The script simply didn't call for a whole lot of deep characterization, and this film didn't need it. In fact, what little drama there was seemed like excess baggage.Second, the directing was competent for something like this. Nothing remotely stylish, but adequate. Decent editing. Cinematography was really nice at times, with lighting low enough to be moody, but still light enough to see the action. Also, the lighting seemed very realistic throughout most of the film, usually seeming like flourescents in a hallway or arc-lighting on the deck, no beautiful "artsy" lighting as in some movies. An instance or two of the shaky, hand-held camera so popular today, but not enough to be distracting.Third, this was obviously filmed on a real oil-rig, so I don't know what movie the people complaining about the sets watched. Nothing more to say on that.Finally, the Monster. Pretty decent man-in-a-suit, think "Humanoids from the Deep" here with an "Alien" make-over. I know that there is a clue-less strata of movie-goer out there that thinks that CGI, no matter how badly done, must trump the traditional methods, no matter how well done. Suffice to say, they are dead wrong.Now, for the problems.First, one of the reasons I wanted to see this was because I like William Forsythe, and, to be sure, he had a good role. Unfortunately, he just wasn't seen that much. Clearly, they had managed to land a "name" draw, but were unable to pay him for the duration.Second, the directing and/or the script. Like I had noted previously, the directing was competent, but in order to create suspense, you have to do better than that. Too many derivitave scenes here, one lifted directly from the original "Alien". Yes, I know that these sort of things are expected of flicks like these. That cuts no mustard with me when you obviously have the components to make something better.Lastly, the Monster. Yes, I know I said that it was pretty decent above, and it was, for a Man-in-a-suit. My problem with it is this: Why would something anthropomorphic come up from the bottom of the ocean? I mean, it should be like an eel, or giant lung-fish, or crab, or a squid-thingy, but human? I realize they never explained exactly what it was, and there lies my second problem with it. Not that everything has to be rationalized, but if you aren't going to do that, then at least make the creature something that one can truly believe might come out of the sea.Now, it is possible that, after reading all the negatives here, my expectations were lowered so that I was pleasantly surprised by it (you see, I'm yet another jaded film-goer). I guess the main problem with this movie is that it isn't good enough to cover new territory and it isn't bad enough to be funny, setting it squarely in the middle as a rather pedestrian viewing experience. But, if it had been a made-for-TV film, most would have considered it one of the better ones. It surely blows away most "made-for-SyFy" features. In fact, in terms of watchability, think of it on a level with some of the lesser Stephen King adaptations for television.In closing, I have to say that the only real fault with this movie, albeit a major one, is that, though not bad on its own, we've all seen it done before and done better with "Leviathan" and "Deep Rising". Only recommended for genre fans, but, if you truly are a B-movie creature-phile, you'll watch it regardless of the carping (get it? Carping...sea monsters, heheh) it will elicit. Go on, you know you want to.
This book seems to cover just about everything. It was highly recommended by a friend - cancer survivor. Good book to have on hand as a reference guide.
If you like the work of Niven, Pournelle, and Laumer, you'll love this book. The characters are well done and the plot moves quickly along as with books by Niven or Pournelle. Do you have some books you come back to and read again after a couple years away? This will likely be one of them.This book alone convinced me find and acquire any similar books by John Ringo.
I was able to get my hands on the xbox 360 version of this game at a walmart kiosk for a good 3 hours late at night. INCREADIBLE to say the least, game play was amazing, graphics blew away any PC or console i have seen hands down. Of course it was being show in HD and I felt like i was in the action, the characters were the best pixeled almost like real life. The standard xbox version is good, i own it, but the xbox 360 version which can only be played on the 360 is increadible....It is worth buying the xbox 360 just for this game its that good!!! I can only think the xbox live will be outstanding.....
What did Shawnna do to get a poorly put together, rushed album out into the stores? Shawnna is pretty nice on the mic, even though the pool of female rappers isn't that deep right now, but she didn't deserve this. Her first single off `Worth Tha Weight' was on point in "Shake Dat Sh**" w/ Ludacris, but the rest is pretty much scattered low filler material. "R.P.M" w/ Twista & Ludacris was already on the `Golden Grain' album, but it's a great song for the people who didn't here it. My favorites on this album are "My Chicago pt 1" & "My Chicago pt 2", produced by B-Crucial, but here's the thing-they're both less than a minute long and are both the same beat, which won't cut it. DTP/Def Jam should have taken A LOT more time in gettin' this album made, cause I'm sure everyone who bought this got BURNED bad.
This bar is one of my favorites. I switch between this and 2 other "organic greens" bars before my morning run every a.m. It's almost too sweet for me but I've gotten used to it and the belgium chocolate makes it so rich. You get these little chunks of fabulous chocolate in every bite along with all the goodness of healthy, organic greens and ingredients and it tastes too good to be healthy. Some days I can't help but eat more than one throughout the day..they are that good!I am getting ready for another order before my other 2 bar flavors are even out just because I don't like being without this flavor. I crave it and so does my hub who has to have bites out of every one of these he sees me with. :D (Yeah, I give him his very own whole one occasionally....)
Gives a great overview and dives into specifics using pictures and drawings that are very helpful. I held back one star because it did not cover wells and pumps as detailed as I would have liked.Only other improvement would be to print on waterproof paper. :-)
WOW! this was a REALLY good movie. i was a bit nervous to watch it, but I am so glad I did. You definately don't need to be a mountain climber to enjoy this movie. It had everything drama, suspense, romance. really well done great cinematography. Great store. I highly recommend this movie, very moving
A misguided friend of mine gave me this to read while I was in the hospital around 30 years ago. It was new at the time, and praised highly. I couldn't stand it. The novel was boring, amateurish and unreadable, obviously written by a talentless individual. (The first chapter felt like trying to run a marathon in quicksand.) I still don't understand why it was published, except perhaps to prove that Pulitzer prize winners are usually overrated. Awful.
I didn't realize that Mary was an Iyengar instructor until she started stacking up blankets to form a bolster, then I caught on.If you already are practicing the Iyengar style, I am sure you will like this video. There are not a lot of Iyengar videos out there, and this is well done.For those not familiar with the style, it is not a "flowing" style like Ashtanga. In a typical class you would work on a pose for a while, then work on a different pose. It's actually ideally suited to construct practices out of segments, as on this DVD.It's a great way to really learn a pose thoroughly, even if you are practicing a different form of yoga.By the way, ignore the "weight loss" title. There is nothing on this video that is specific for that purpose. If your aim in practicing yoga is to have an intense workout and burn calories, this is not the type of video you are looking for.
The authors kept on giving the same speech over and over again about the academic establishment. The constant ranting should have been handled once in the intro and then the authors should have gone on and made there point. It's to bad because when the authors actually focus on there interesting theory they have a potentually good book unfortunately they love to give there speech to much.
Hollywood studios know about the research linking on-screen tobacco imagery with youth smoking rates, yet they continue to produce G, PG and PG-13 movies that promote smoking! That includes this summer's Land of the Lost, a Universal film that was heavily marketed to children. Numerous tobacco images in the PG-13 film have resulted in as many as 125 million impressions.Land of the Lost IS THE WORST!This movie gives the classic 1970s' A BAD NAME!Please BAN the Movie!
There are reviews for this all over Amazon and the web. The thing I like the most is that now when I run I know that this will put it in my face when I get home. I know I am being tracked from my speed, heart rate, etc. If I choose to slow down the graph will show it as plain as day. I love it!Also there is a free product out there that it much better than the out of the box software this comes with. It is called SportTracks...google it.
In her pregnancy book, she seemed angry and bitter about being pregnant. In this book, she seems angry and bitter about the sacrifices of mothering.Giving birth and being a mother are the most difficult things I've ever done, but they're also the most rewarding. I wouldn't trade them for anything. I'm sure that Iovine loves her children, but what a way to vent! Not only was this book depressing, but it didn't make me laugh. I felt sorry for her. Being a mother certainly has its &quot;moments,&quot; but I go to my &quot;girlfriends&quot; for support and encouragment, not commiseration about how awful it is to be a mother.If you want a good laugh with your girlfriends, go to your real friends, not this book. You can have a laugh about the unexpected twists and turns your life is taking and still rejoice in the miracle of your young family.
Well, in my house we're down to the last two episodes of The Complete Fourth Season. Just as with the first three season DVDs, we've carefully parceled out the episodes for viewing because we know how unbearably long it is between releases of these DVDs. Sometimes we splurge and watch two episodes in a row. Now, however, we are down to two remaining and once again, I've taken to scanning the Amazon website for any sign of the next DVD in the series only to find disappointment. Why does it take so long between releases of the next season on DVD? Why??This is the very best television there ever was - yes, that's right: ever. Do not miss the opportunity to bring the little discs which preserve this television series right into your own home, whether they are encased in parkas (seasons 1-3) or not.To those who, DVD release after DVD release, keep carping about the music, I say: please stop. Your point has been made - and made and made. There is nothing to be done about that issue. It is possible that you are affecting sales of the DVDs with your repetitiously negative comments about the music and that would be a terrible shame. The music was what it was and is what it is. Either way, it is wonderful, delightful music accompanying the best television show ever. You are looking at it with the eyes of nostalgia ("things can never be as good as they were; I miss how things were...") versus looking with child's eyes ("isn't this wonderful!")I appreciate art as much as the next guy and don't want it "messed with" but, you know, Venus used to have arms. Would you rather not see a work at all because you can't see it the way it once was? That is a rigid nostalgia, isn't it? I agree with your point essentially, but what can you do about it? I also hated - and still hate - the Ted Turner colorization of the great old movies and when I have a choice, I only go for the black and white version. We don't have a choice with these Northern Exposure DVDs and anyway, the fact is that the music on the DVDs is still very good.It's an extraordinarily wonderful show, in its original form and now on these DVDs. In my opinion the ONLY problem with these DVDs is that they are so very slow to be released.
I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real "premium" dog foods brag that they've no corn.Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real "premium" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real "premium" dog foods do not have.In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!
Heavy duty pasta roller and cutters work great. I wish the roller had a couple of wider initial settings because you have to flatten your dough pieces out pretty flat by hand before you can run them through. The number settings on the roller are a bit difficult for old eyes to read. Nevertheless, this is so much easier, faster, and better than kneading and rolling pasta dough with hands and a rolling pin! The spaghetti cutter can clog if the ends of your rolled pasta dry out, so just keep the rolled pieces covered with a damp cloth until you're ready to cut them.
This this device is limited compared to some readers but is perfect for those of us that want to down/upload compact flash with the camera or PDA and the Laptop. I bought this after I used a friends to transfer a program. It has its own driver built into the unit so you do not need to waste any time with a floppy disk or CD and after two seconds it was usable. This reader is a great value compared to some memory stick type drives.
WOW, what an amazing book on how Central banking cartels have started wars to profit from both sides.EVERY American needs to read this book to figure out what is going on in today's economy.I cannot recommend this book stronger than that.Reaing this book will save you 4 years at a university studying economics.
True, Andy Latimer's the only REAL Camel guy on it, but this album is unfairly dumped-on by Camel fans. The whole 2nd side is gorgeous, especially "Sasquatch" & "A Heart's Desire/End Peace," "Manic" is an Xtremely angry-sounding tale of schizophrenia, & "Camelogue" & "Today's Goodbye" R at least pleasant & intresting. The 1st side's more of a problem: "No Easy Answer" is OK, & "Heroes" is nice ... but the rest IS a significant drop-off in quality from previous albums. So play the 2nd side, Njoy the guest work by Peter Bardens & Anthony Phillips, & take it 4 what it is -- perhaps not as "progressive" as the band's hard-core fans would like, but still real nice. I think Latimer held-up pretty well under the commercial pressure from his record company. This is as good as the earlier BREATHLESS and I CAN SEE YOUR HOUSE FROM HERE, if not as solid as SNOW GOOSE or NUDE....
Guy almost dies. Now, guy thinks he's invincible. That's just about it. This movie is a yawner, folks. I love Jeff Bridges and think he's a great actor, but you can toss this one in the trash, along with Arlington Road. Of course, it does have a nice low price, if your ego is dependent upon how DVDs you have stacked on the shelf.
After coming out of the theatre having watched Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith for the first time, I came away feeling somewhat disappointed with certain aspects of this movie. Bear with me here. First, Anakin's turn to the Dark Side seemed very abrupt and without explanation. Don't get me wrong though, this flick is packed with action and drama, and I enjoyed it immensely.But after watching this movie a few more times, it all has begun to make sense, and Episode 3 has really begun to grow on me. The only important things to Anakin Skywalker were the desperate love he had for his wife, and the well-being of the Republic. The fear of losing his wife to death, increasing frustration with a Jedi Council that has denied him the role of Jedi Master, and a council with whom he has gradually become suspicious of due to the whisperings of the shady Chancellor Palpatine.. causes Anakin's mind begins to be clouded with fear, doubt, and confusion.When Anakin discovers the truth about who Palpatine really is, and that he may be the only one who can help Anakin achieve the power needed to save his wife, he is faced with a difficult choice. Does he bring Palpatine to justice at the hands of a Jedi Council whom he doesn't completely trust anymore and let the power to save his wife die with the Chancellor? Being young, impressionable, and caught up in the heat of the moment, Anakin makes the wrong choice. After preventing Mace from killing Palpatine, Anakin is then convinced that the Jedi Council's intent really was to overthrow the chancellor and betray the republic, and Anakin believes his suspicions to be confirmed.All of that said, I still believe that Anakin's turn to the dark side was rushed, and the series could have benefited greatly from another movie that would show more of Anakin's journey to darkness. The casual Star Wars fan will most likely not find Anakin's turn as credible. I know, it's alot to digest, but just watch this movie a couple of times and put yourself in Anakin's situation. You will then begin to understand Anakin's plight, how his mind was manipulated by Palpatine, and how circumstance after circumstance led him further down the dark path.Although the movie has flaws (hence my 4 star rating and not 5), and the acting and script in Revenge of the Sith was not a big improvement from Episode 2, Episode 3 bridges to Episode 4 nicely. I also am not going to whine about a couple of small details or a small plot hole here and there between the original trilogy and the prequel and give the movie 1 star. I guess plot holes are bound to happen when you write the 2nd half of the story first, and later write the first half. The action, drama, special affects, and gripping score are more than enough to compensate for the film's shortcomings, making it a worthy finale to the series.
